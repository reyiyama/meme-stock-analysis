investing_discussion,Anyone looking into $EMOR?,"Just stumbled upon this company called Healixa and man, it's got me all intrigued about the whole healthcare sector.  You know, it's funny how sometimes you casually read up on things and suddenly you're down the rabbit hole learning about new opportunities. I've been keeping an eye on this sector lately, and I gotta say, there's some serious potential brewing here.

**/summary/Take backs:**  
  
Okay, so the financial world can be a rollercoaster, and investing in a single company can be risky. Diversification, anyone?   


It's true, we've all seen startups fizzle out. Not every company makes it big, and the same goes for Healixa.   


And hey, market trends can be a double-edged sword. Just 'cause healthcare is booming, doesn't mean every player will ride the wave. 

**Three reasons I'm leaning towards it:**  
  
The healthcare sector is on the rise, with technology changing the game. Healixa seems to be tapping into that sweet spot where innovation meets health. 

They've got this platform that's all about telehealth and wellness services. In an era of convenience, that sounds pretty darn appealing.   


Call me crazy, but I kinda like that they're focusing on mental health too. It's like they're addressing the stuff that's not always talked about but matters a ton. 

&#x200B;

**In conclusion:**   
So, there you have it, pals. Healixa is making waves in the healthcare scene, and it's caught my attention for sure. No hard sell here, just a bunch of curious minds coming together. If you're into researching potential investments, might be worth giving this one a look. But hey, remember, do your own due diligence and all that jazz.

investing_discussion,who has more info on Mondee,"Mondee Holdings, Inc. is making waves in the stock market!  Their share price took a nosedive, sliding 45% over the last year, a stark contrast to the market's 2.8% return. It's like a financial thriller, with twists and turns that keep us on our toes.  
  
Recent developments have seen the falls accelerate, with the share price down 37% in just the last three months.  Could this be linked to their recent financial results? The intrigue deepens as we explore the dynamics behind these fluctuations.  
  
Given their loss over the past year, it's likely that the market is keeping a keen eye on Mondee Holdings' revenue and growth prospects. Revenue growth becomes even more crucial for companies that aren't turning a profit. And here's the twist ‚Äì in the last twelve months, Mondee Holdings managed to grow its revenue by a solid 29%.  But wait, there's a catch ‚Äì despite this growth, the share price took a hit, leaving us to ponder whether there's more to this puzzle than meets the eye.  
  
The involvement of insiders in significant purchases adds an interesting layer to the story. However, it's earnings and revenue growth trends that usually take the spotlight. Think of it like dissecting the DNA of a company's financial health.  
  
While market performance over the past year might raise an eyebrow, remember that even the best stocks have their ups and downs.  The recent decline could be signaling a lack of investor enthusiasm, potentially hinting at underlying issues.

Just recently, it hit a new 52-week high at $72.05, underscoring its upward momentum.

Considering the stock's outstanding performance, positive earnings surprises, and its projected growth, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories appears to be a bullish contender in the investment landscape.  
  
While Zacks‚Äô analysis showcased Dr Reddy‚Äôs performance on the New York Stock Exchange, its Indian listing has likewise mirrored the recent gains. Whereas RDY share price has gained 12% over the past month, DRREDDY has likewise tracked an 11% rise, indicating robust financials that are a windfall for investors worldwide.  
  
In conclusion, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is a compelling investment opportunity that demands attention.

The company is called BriaCell Therapeutics (BCTX). They're a biotechnology company that focuses on developing novel immunotherapies for treating advanced-stage breast cancer and other types of cancer.  Here are the reasons I'm thinking of investing in them and hesitant to invest in them.

**Reason's I'm hesitant** 

The biotech industry can be quite volatile, so there might be some wild price swings.   


It's essential to keep an eye on the competition in this space. Some big players might give BriaCell a run for their money.   


Clinical trials and regulatory stuff can be unpredictable, and that could impact the company's journey. 

 **Why you are leaning towards investing in the business:**  
  
Their cancer immunotherapy approach seems promising, and we all know how crucial advancements in cancer treatment are!   


I've been hearing positive murmurs about their early trial results.   


As more and more people become health-conscious, investing in biotech companies like BriaCell could align with the current trends.

investing_discussion,How I Outperformed the S&P 500 and You Can Too (5 Steps),"Over the past several months, I have consistently outperformed all major indexes. Only about 10% of fund managers are able to do this, so how on earth did I? The answer is, very simply, **taking advantage of artificial intelligence.** Below I have listed step by step how I got upwards of 443% annualized returns and how you can too.  
**AI, why is it so useful for investing?** AI, such as chat gbt have access to more information than any individual on earth. They have access to and take advantage of earnings calls, macro-economic data found in articles, and use this information to make predictions using complex formulas it finds on the web.  
**Ok, AI is powerful, how do I use it?** There are two ways of unleashing the power of AI to find bullish investments:  
**Method 1 (Less recommended)** One is using chat gpt or something similar to give you macro-economic data, and then you can manually look at this data and make decisions based off of it. However, this is not the way I did it, as the process of manually making decisions is a process that is much more accurate and faster when artificial intelligence does it, hence, method 2.  
**Method 2 (recommended)** Instead of using artificial intelligence to make your life easier finding the data you need, you can also you AI to directly just give you stock picks. However, this is not something chat gbt can do, you would need to find a service. But don't fear, I am not trying to sell a service, as the one I used is free. You can find it [here](http://darringer.com/stockpicks/index.html), or you can use a paid service like yuyostox, but they run pretty expensive at like $100 a month, so I stick to this service I linked above called Darringer AI Investments, they send an email every week with what their algorithm has picked up as bullish investments. All of these services have an algorithm that takes in this data and looks and patterns, and I am not a computer scientist but this method works.  
**Last step - actually investing.** Once I received the weekly email, I looked at the reasoning behind each investment, and choose the stock with reasoning that made the most sense to me. I held on for a couple months, and sometimes lost money, but mainly made huge profits off of the stock picks. I figured that because I made literally thousands from this service and didn't pay them a cent, I feel morally obligated to at least tell others about my road to riches :)","['You found a way to outperform by 443% and you post that on Reddit instead of selling your solution to a hedge fund ? üòÇüòÇ \nSure man that can only be true', 'I bought options on the cloud computing industry (WCLD).

I‚Äôve had a few coworkers that have invested in crypto and penny stocks, but I want something more stable and long term (7-10 years). I am wanting to have both short term and long term investments. 

Any advice on where I can start out? There‚Äôs so much information out there that it can be overwhelming to get started. I want to be financially literate, and reduce my debt as well as invest for long term gain. 

Thank you!",['Id lay off the internet a bit and go to the library and get some investing books. Just grab whatever catches your eye.']
investing_discussion,Question!,"Hello, I have a question.

Is it legal to offer investment opportunities to the public? For example if I run a business or have a side hustle, could i offer an opportunity of investment to others in order to fuel the growth of said business? Thanks in advance.","[""How many billionaires started their business in a garage- a lot!

I started a daily curated newsletter that shares links and bite-sized news on markets, stocks, and ETFs. I work as an ETF wholesaler so I scour different sources for investing-related speaking points on a daily basis.

Out of most of the moats the hardest to understand for me is a brand moat. 

How do you determine it? It always seems that articles say that a company has a brand moat if you can get consumers to pay more for it's product like Coke vs Generic Black Soda

Nike vs Adidas 


But what does that actually mean? 

Does Sony has a brand moat? Sony use to be the go to for TVs and they can charge a premium for it? But these days is that still true?","['The first step will be to Have a look at the gross margin, if a company can produce something at 20 and sell it at a 100 (totally arbitrary number just to give you an idea) they MAY be some kind of moat.

investing_discussion,How Small Business Holding Companies can be a VC alternative for the average investor,"SBHCs (like $BOMN, and $MBHCF) are a public holding companies created to facilitate the financing and support of small businesses. SBHCs are intended to be public companies and, somewhat like a mutual fund, can serve as a collective investment vehicle to invest in other companies.¬†

However, while mutual funds have to invest at least 85% of their assets in publicly traded securities (stocks and bonds by companies listed on the stock market), an SBHC invests in and owns a large number of small, private (not public) businesses. Think of them as a public venture capital company or mutual fund for small businesses. **This allows the average person, not just wealthy investors, to invest in something that resembles a VC fund**.

Furthermore, SBHC also help bring resources like capital and expertise usually exclusive to public companies down to local small businesses, increase their chances to survive, grow and better serve their communities.

How do SBHC's work? well, they gather acquire a group of SMEs together into an entity large enough to be a public company. So instead of investing in an individual small company, investors invest in the public SBHC, which then invests in many small businesses at one time. Helping to spreads the risk, providing liquidity, and facilitating the recouping of the original investment plus a healthy return.

That is not to say that there are no risks involved in investing in SBHCs, potential investors have to a few key factors to ascertain whether the SBHC is worth investing in. Firstly, they must ensure that the holding company has a diverse and profitable collection of SMEs in their portfolio. Additionally, investors must also looks at whether the SBHC has a solid history of financial performance and whether the company is taking on a large amount of debt in order to fund their acquisitions. Lastly, investors should also look at the overall growth plan of the SBHC, as well as their acquisition plan in order to ascertain if the company has the potential to continue growing.",[]

investing_discussion,Investing Options-Canada,"Hello. I'm currently 29, married with one child, single income household. During COVID moved in with in laws for a myriad of reasons. Currently able to save about $2200/month, and that's a fairly conservative amount considering my occupation offers plenty of OT to make extra. 

I can say with reasonable certainty that we will remain single income for the foreseeable future. We have $200k in the bank. I expect a considerable amount to come in the next few years from inheritance, nothing for certain but I anticipate to grow to ~$250k by the time everything goes through. 

We are essentially unable to get a loan for a mortgage for a place of our own being single income. Even if we got the loan, we would be so close every month to the budget we'd most likely become ""house poor"". There has been some talk of either buying out the in laws to buy their house, or going in together on a place in the future, either of which I'd be good with.

In summary, I expect to not need to move our funds out of the bank anytime soon. What would you invest in the mean time, just so our money can do  something for us despite sitting in the bank.","['Based on my own investing journey, i would only invest the money that I can afford to lose. Simply because I still have to pay rent and account for my daily expenses. \n\nSetting aside a large enough portion to get by my daily life is super essential. \n\nWhilst the extra are what I called ‚Äúmoney I can afford to lose‚Äù. The reason is because equities are not as liquid as they are despite one can sell them easily at the exchange. This is because reasonable human being won‚Äôt want to sell their stocks at a loss unless better opportunity emerge or the company is beyond salvage; hence, cutting losses seems like a viable choice. \n\nTherefore, investing into long term and expect a great return would be a better option.', ""I invested $83,000 on bitcoin, believing I will receive 40% interest after 3 weeks of investing in a binary option where a broker will trade on my behalf and send my profit, I was unable to reach the broker, he blocked my number and ran away with my money, fortunately, I was referred to this company they‚Äôre professional programmers who helped me recover all my money that the scammers took from me, they‚Äôre also on Instagram'(@golf_hack_team)""]"

I was a victim of a sneaky company that purchased a local business, sold the real estate saying it's ""just an accounting difference"" then shut the company's doors.   I want to know if this happens again so that I dont visit those type of businesses.

investing_discussion,"Need Understanding of ""Risk"" in Terms of Investing","I understand what ""risk"" means in common usage, but it feels like it is used in a very different way in investing. I understand for example, that VUG fell 40% in the six months following the end of August 2008. But in the worst case of a large fall, it has always recovered within 18 months... Often much sooner. And always averaged 10% or (much) better growth as measured from before the ""crash"" to 3 years after any such ""crash"".

So, does ""risk"" just mean that you are at risk of having to occasionally wait up to 18 months for recovery, as you otherwise consistently get 20%+? Is it not considered ""high risk"" when an investment will almost certainly lose money to inflation due to poor performance, just because it is more shielded from the potential big drops?

Thanks for any thoughts or opinions on this.","[""I invested $83,000 on bitcoin, believing I will receive 40% interest after 3 weeks of investing in a binary option where a broker will trade on my behalf and send my profit, I was unable to reach the broker, he blocked my number and ran away with my money, fortunately, I was referred to this company they‚Äôre professional programmers who helped me recover all my money that the scammers took from me, they‚Äôre also on Instagram'(@golf_hack_team)""]"
investing_discussion,Klimat X finalized its first of many long term revenue contracts with a fortune 100 company,"I‚Äôve been following Klimat X for a few months now and James Tansey (CEO) has made exceptional progress advancing his projects forward as well as completing a major milestone by finalizing a  long term revenue contract with a fortune 100 company which has validated the entire business model. A friend of mine made a great WIKI explaining the company and the plans moving forward:

‚ö°‚ö° Demand for carbon credits expected to grow to a $180bn market by 2050 due to increased pressure to meet net zero targets. Supply for those credits is currently constrained, with a lack of high quality carbon credit projects in existence. Enter Klimat X; $KLX https://www.klimatx.com/ ‚ö°‚ö°

‚óæ $KLX is a carbon exploration and development company that supplies high quality carbon credits to meet this demand by developing high quality reforesting and conservations projects from conception to feasibility to validation and production. KLX is able to develop turnkey projects from feasibility through validation in 12-24 months by establishing the carbon potential (PDD-level) and securing land rights. At the end of the feasibility stage, turnkey projects can be developed internally with project-level financing or sold to corporate off-takers and carbon focused banks.

‚úÖ $KLX has released the terms of their first presale agreement with a üí•Fortune 100 companyüí•, one of 16 bidders on their first project in Sierra Leone. Other bidders included some of the largest trading houses in the world -> Mercuria, Trafigura, Hartree and Glencore. Large final emitters in technology, energy and resource sectors are buying credits to meet their offset obligations; Amazon, Alphabet, Shell, BP etc. The pre-purchase agreement will cover the remaining capital costs of the first 5,000 ha of native species planting, with 1,000-1,200 ha of planting. 

üí•üí•The first three payments to Klimat X of US$500,000 are scheduled for the balance of 2023, with the first payments already received.  Under the pre-purchase financing structure, US$2.5 million of investment is repaid in tons of carbon credits issued at a pre-agreed price by the project. The buyer holds the option to purchase the balance of 75% to 80% of the carbon credits from the first 5,000 ha of planting at a small discount to a mutually agreed carbon index price. Klimat X noted that the first 5,000 ha is anticipated to produce 1.6-1.9 million tonnes of carbon credits during the first 30 years, and over the full lifespan and scale-up of the project, it has the potential to produce up to 15 million tonnes of credits from 25,000 ha.üí• ROFO on remaining 20,000 ha triggered immediately, NAME TO BE ANNOUNCED SOON üí• üí•

‚úÖ Carbon credits are verified by third party organizations who manage protocols and registries; Gold Standard and Verra. Issuance of terms happens through a static registry, then are managed and retired on behalf of the buyers of those credits. 

‚úÖ First 25,000 ha in Sierra Leone with a 10% discount rate has an NPV of $30 million. Another 32,000 ha which is also under agreement has a $40 million USD NPV with a 10% discount rate. Another $40 million in cumulative NPV within more projects in the pipeline total of üí• $100+ million NPVüí•. Cumulative revenue over the lifespan of these projects is close to ‚ö°$2 billion USD‚ö°. 

‚úÖ Due to the market being so short on credits, $KLX has been able to make pre purchase agreements for those credits. KLX has spent $2 million USD in Sierra Leone securing the land rights and developing reforestation projects. Through a prepurchase agreement, KLX is able to fund the costs of all their tree planting and restoration efforts on the guarantee of access to the credits. No financing for these projects are required, as the buyer pays for all the costs and is paid back in credits. Waiting on the PR team from the üí•Fortune 100 companyüí• to be announced, which could come at anytime.

‚úÖ $KLX is one of the only publicly traded companies that directly owns Nature-based carbon offset projects, selling wholesale to large buyers. Most competitors are privately owned and limited to 8-10 years of funding, making it difficult to complete longer term projects that last 50 - 60 years.

‚úÖ $KLX currently has $3 million in liabilities and $20 million in assets; liabilities are future obligations for payments, as there is no third party debt within the company. 

‚úÖ $KLX has less than 10 employees with very low burn rate and impressive capital structure: 60% insider ownership (87,250,040 shares; 3,849,040 warrants and option‚Äôs)
They've initially raised $9.7 million which was all invested into project development. They currently fund their projects and secure capital through pre-purchase agreements. 100% of the revenue from those sales flows back through the business. They've turned $2 million in initial cost for their first Sierra Leone project into a potential $580 million USD cumulative revenue over the life of that project. Total cost for that project is expected to be $17 million.

‚úÖ $KLX has an extremely qualified board of directors & executive team with decades of cumulative experience finance and resource sectors:

     Management Team:

     ‚óæ Neil Passmore (Director) --> https://energycouncil.com/event-speakers/neil-passmore/

      

‚úÖ $KLX is one of the only companies offering retail investors an opportunity to enter this market, as most companies offering exposure to ESG & nature based solutions for climate change are privately funded.

‚úÖ Current pipeline of 45M tonnes with 100M by end of 2023 and 200M by end of 2024. Company goal is 1billion

investing_discussion,How Small Business Holding Companies can be a VC alternative for the average investor,"SBHCs (like $BOMN, and $MBHCF) are a public holding companies created to facilitate the financing and support of small businesses. SBHCs are intended to be public companies and, somewhat like a mutual fund, can serve as a collective investment vehicle to invest in other companies.¬†

However, while mutual funds have to invest at least 85% of their assets in publicly traded securities (stocks and bonds by companies listed on the stock market), an SBHC invests in and owns a large number of small, private (not public) businesses. Think of them as a public venture capital company or mutual fund for small businesses. **This allows the average person, not just wealthy investors, to invest in something that resembles a VC fund**.

Furthermore, SBHC also help bring resources like capital and expertise usually exclusive to public companies down to local small businesses, increase their chances to survive, grow and better serve their communities.

How do SBHC's work? well, they gather acquire a group of SMEs together into an entity large enough to be a public company. So instead of investing in an individual small company, investors invest in the public SBHC, which then invests in many small businesses at one time. Helping to spreads the risk, providing liquidity, and facilitating the recouping of the original investment plus a healthy return.

That is not to say that there are no risks involved in investing in SBHCs, potential investors have to a few key factors to ascertain whether the SBHC is worth investing in. Firstly, they must ensure that the holding company has a diverse and profitable collection of SMEs in their portfolio. Additionally, investors must also looks at whether the SBHC has a solid history of financial performance and whether the company is taking on a large amount of debt in order to fund their acquisitions. Lastly, investors should also look at the overall growth plan of the SBHC, as well as their acquisition plan in order to ascertain if the company has the potential to continue growing.",[]

dividends,JEPI - Stop yield chasing without understanding the product you're purchasing.,"Numerous discussions on this forum have revolved around individuals heavily investing in JEPI within taxable accounts. When the inherent flaws of such a strategy are highlighted, the common responses often entail, ""Everyone's financial situation is unique,"" or ""Taxes shouldn't be the primary determinant of investment choices,"" among other arguments.

Nevertheless, this perspective is misguided and investing in JEPI within a taxable account should unequivocally be avoided. Allow me to enlighten you on why this is the case.

**Covered Calls: A Brief Overview**

Let's first understand JEPI and the concept of covered call strategies. A call option offers the buyer a right, without an obligation, to purchase the underlying asset (such as a stock, index, commodity, etc.) at a pre-established price at a future date. This right is obtained by paying a premium. JEPI, on the other hand, is in the business of selling these call options to earn the associated premiums.

In a covered call strategy, the portfolio manager holds an investment in the underlying asset while selling a call on that same asset. If the stock value plummets to zero, the investor's maximum loss would be the value of the stock minus the premium received. This is one way JEPI manages to lower its overall volatility. On the other hand, the highest payoff happens when the stock price rises just below the call price, where the holder retains the underlying asset and collects the full premium. Any additional increase in the stock price would be disadvantageous as it would increase the cost of reinvesting in the stock that was ""called away.""

**Premium Value Determinants**

The premium of an option depends on various factors including the time to expiry, volatility of the underlying asset, prevailing interest rates, the strike price, and the current price of the underlying asset. Changes in these factors can affect the premium amount received by JEPI for selling call options. The fund's goal to minimize beta exposure and volatility means some factors like time to expiry and out-of-the-money component remain relatively constant over time. The primary factors affecting the option premium are likely to be volatility and interest rates, which can fluctuate over different periods.

**Composition of the High Yield**

JEPI aims to achieve an annualized yield between 6‚Äì10% through a combination of 1-2% dividends and 6-8% options premiums. The remaining return potential comes from variable equity market exposure. The fund is anticipated to perform well in volatile environments and could outperform broader indices during downturns. However, it might underperform during sharp market rallies.

**Portfolio Composition**

The majority of JEPI's holdings are equity and REIT positions, comprising nearly 80-85% of the total equity holdings. This portfolio, which has a noticeable underweight in the IT sector and several other sector-specific bets, displays a defensive tilt.

The footnote in the prospectus mentions a ""convertible bonds"" sector, but in reality, it's exclusively composed of equity-linked notes (ELNs). I've seen these holdings accounted range from 15-20% of the fund by market value. **JEPI's covered-call exposure is entirely within the ELNs**, which are designed to provide returns linked to the underlying assets within the note. These ELNs are typically contracted for one week and tend to be out of the money.

ELNs are investment products that blend fixed-income investments with potential returns linked to equities' performance. ELNs are essentially contracts with other institutions that generate income and could potentially be a better alternative to covered calls, unless a financial crisis leads to defaults on these contracts.

About 15-20% of JEPI's portfolio is composed of ELNs that generate almost all of its income, which is distributed as monthly dividends. Meanwhile, 80-85% of the portfolio is made up of high-quality blue-chip stocks aiming to generate returns.

It's important to remember that a key reason for JEPI's high yield and outstanding returns is its use of ELNs. However, if these contracts' counterparties default, JEPI's income could collapse. Not saying it's likely, just a risk I never see anyone acknowledge.

Secondly, **ELN income and covered call income are generally taxed at ordinary income rates**. Just 15-20% of JEPI's dividends are qualified, implying that it's best to hold it in a tax-deferred retirement account. F**or high-income investors, the effective tax rate for JEPI could be close to 50% if held in taxable accounts.**

Moreover, owing to its high annual turnover of 195%, JEPI's tax implications are significant. Over the past year, **40% of returns were eroded** due to taxes and high turnover-related expenses.

In conclusion, for wealthy investors in the top tax bracket, the promise of 6-10% returns might only yield 3-5%. Therefore, even though JEPI's combination of low volatility blue-chip stocks and out-of-the-money ELNs, along with excellent active management, has so far produced remarkable returns, potential investors must be aware of certain risks.

Key Takeaways for Potential JEPI Investors

\- ELNs expose JEPI to counterparty risk

\- In the event of another financial crisis, JEPI's income could suffer a significant blow

\- If you don't reinvest most of JEPI's dividends, your principal will erode over time, adjusted for inflation

\- 80-85% of JEPI's dividends are taxed as ordinary income, thus it's optimal to own it in tax-deferred retirement accounts.

I know I'm going to get absolutely gutted with the post, but, I can't watch the madness continue.

TLDR: Tax efficiency matters, investments and the types of accounts they are held within needs to be considered, and after-tax returns needs to be a metric that should be top of mind.","['Welcome to r/dividends!\n\nIf you are new to the world of dividend investing and are seeking advice, brokerage information, recommendations, and more, please check out the Wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/wiki/faq).\n\nRemember, this is a subreddit for genuine, high-quality discussion.

Good explanation.  Tip of the hat on that part of it, anyway.  \n\nHowever, **your conclusions are for shit**.  You start off with a real doozy:   \n\n>investing in JEPI within a taxable account should unequivocally be avoided.\n\nThis is unequivocally wrong.  You later conclude: \n\n>for wealthy investors in the top tax bracket, the promise of 6-10% returns might only yield 3-5%\n\nSo, yeah, for high income investors, they\'re going to get hammered by taxes on the returns.  **Your math is incredibly wrong** \\- *no one\'s losing half of JEPI to taxes* \\- but otherwise, sure.  That\'s fine.  That\'s a fair conclusion. \n\nBut, hey, guess what?  *Not everyone is in the top tax bracket!*  Wow!  What a stunning revelation that is, huh?  \n\nI invest in JEPI/Q.  I invest in them in a regular, taxable account.  I am not in the top tax bracket - not even close.  I\'m in the 22% bracket.  And, y\'know what?  Most people - even most investors - aren\'t in the 37%, 35%,  32%, or even the 24% brackets.  \n\nSo, yup, factoring in state income taxes, too, I\'m losing just over a quarter of my JEPI/Q money to taxes.  So, if I\'m losing soooo much money, as you state, then why do I do it?  \n\nI do it because I\'m close to retirement.  I max out my ROTH every year, and have for decades.  Where else am I supposed to put my money?  I want current extra income, in my pocket, *right now*.  I\'m spending it on living better, *right now*, while I\'m still young enough to enjoy it:  nicer vacations, more concerts, better cuts of steak.  \n\nAnd for that purpose, *right now*, JEPI/Q is unparalleled in providing current income.  \n\nOh, there are the \\*YLD funds.  The problem with them is that they stink on ice.  Take the leader, QYLD.  Its price decays over time.  Why?  Because the \\*YLDs sell at-the-money calls - they capture exactly NONE of the upside, and participate in ALL of the downside.  \n\nThat doesn\'t happen with JEPI/Q.  As you mentioned, they sell out-of-the money calls through those ELNs.  JEPI/Q does capture some of the upside.  \n\nAnd yeah, younger investors - say, under 45 or so - shouldn\'t be in JEPI.  VOO/VTI/SCHD will crush JEPI over longer time periods of 10-20-30 years.  Being in JEPI when you\'re young, or younger, anyway, is just plain dumb, taxable account or no.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you don\'t reinvest most of JEPI\'s dividends, your principal will erode over time, adjusted for inflation\n\nMy personal hypothesis on any dividend-paying investment is that none of them will beat the overall market; i.e., VOO, the S&P 500.  The S&P has a long-term average annual gain of 10%.  Any other investment merely chops that into pieces.  SCHD?  It\'s got a long-term 3% dividend, and 7% annual gain.  \n\nJEPI flips those numbers - the fund manager says (and you\'ve said it after a fashion, too) that the long-term yield is expected to be 7% . . . which it\'s not even hitting this month.  And that says to me, and my unproven hypothesis, that JEPI should grow, on average, about 3% per year.  JEPI\'s not gonna beat the market.  Nothing does.  \n\nBut 3% matches the long-term rate of inflation, so you\'re not losing money with JEPI.  Your principal will not erode over time.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>80-85% of JEPI\'s dividends are taxed as ordinary income, thus it\'s optimal to own it in tax-deferred retirement accounts.\n\nOptimal?  Sure.  But unequivocally wrong not to?  Nope.  \n\nI\'m fine with holding JEPI in a regular, taxable account, and getting an after-tax return in my pocket of about 5%, month in, month out, from it.  I\'ve got $80K in JEPI.  This month, my dividend is ""only"" $407 - my lowest one by far.  But that still works out to almost $4900 per year.  And that means that I\'m still getting $3600 = $300 per month after taxes.  \n\n$300 in after-tax money per month gets me a lotta upgrades in life.  It sure makes my life nicer.  Right now.  \n\nFinally, when you say:\n\n>However, if these contracts\' counterparties default, JEPI\'s income could collapse. Not saying it\'s likely, just a risk I never see anyone acknowledge.\n\nand then conclude as your very first conclusion:\n\n>ELNs expose JEPI to counterparty risk\n\nI\'ve been on these subs for just over a year and a half now.  I\'ve read people talking about this counterparty risk plenty - especially a few months back, when Credit Suisse was on the ropes.  So, yet another incorrect assertion on your part.  That\'s hardly a key takeaway about investing in JEPI.  And even less so *the first* key takeaway about it.', 'As a CPA, I am always confused why the tax point is made so heavily against JEPI specifically but not something like bond funds or high end savings accounts.  JEPI‚Äôs dividend is taxed like interest.  Ordinary income.  No one falls over themselves to avoid interest because of high taxes.  Taxes are rarely mentioned as a negative when someone wants to buy a CD or bonds, but people fall all over themselves to say it when someone mentions JEPI or other covered call funds here. \n\nAlso for a lot of people who are investing, they are sitting in that 22% tax bracket. Their preferential tax bracket for LTCG and qualified dividends is at 15%. That difference isn‚Äôt nothing, but is also not the panic inducing difference for most people it is constantly made out here.  In many states, the state does not give preferential treatment to qualified dividends (my two states included) so state taxes are not a factor.  The analysis of tax difference is always stated at the highest brackets, but that isn‚Äôt most people and I suspect not the type of investor that is flocking to JEPI.  It is more those middle class brackets.\n\nNot to say there isn‚Äôt some concern with people buying JEPI and not understanding the options piece. That‚Äôs true.  But the constant posts about JEPI‚Äôs horrible tax treatment are very confusing to me.']"

dividends,"I want to invest in ""buy and never sell"" dividend stocks","*edit edit*
I have received alot of information and stocks to look at. I appreciate everyone taking time to comment! Ive also updated the about me section to help better understand my situation.

Hello! 
I am very very new to investing but the TLDR of what I want is to aggressively  buy stocks, and live off the dividends 5 or 10 years from now. I am able to invest roughly $2-3k a month. I want to be very aggressive with this. 

I don't know what I would look up to start researching. It could be monthly, quarterly or anything. As long as it will give me dividends. I am aiming to receive $1-2k in dividends by the time I retire.

Could anyone suggest some stocks I should look up, so I can compare those stats to future stocks? Or a portfolio that follows a similar goal?

I don't know if this will help but here are some stats about me
$110k a year, 32, $10k in savings. Not many bills. 
Wife makes roughly the same amount as me and she will be contributing as well.


*edit* In 2 years ill be making $200k and it keeps ramping up. I have little to no bills. I receive free healthcare and 80%disability form my military service. Sorry I didnt include this earlier. Wanting to hit the ground running and not look back.

Let\'s dive into the data.\n\n#### Inflation Data\n\nHere\'s how inflation has trended:\n\n| Month | Inflation Rate |\n|-------|----------------|\n| Jan   | 6.4%           |\n| Feb   | 6%             |\n| Mar   | 5%             |\n| Apr   | 4.9%           |\n| May   | 4%             |\n| Jun   | 3%             |\n| Jul   | 3.2%           |\n\nHistorical U.S. inflation rates:\n\n- 2022: **8.00%**, up 3.3% from 2021\n- 2021: **4.70%**, up 3.5% from 2020\n- 2020: **1.23%**, down 0.6% from 2019\n- 2019: **1.81%**, down 0.6% from 2018\n\n#### Yield Data (as of 8/17/23)\n\n| Type         | Yield  |\n|--------------|--------|\n| 30y          | 4.4%   |\n| 10y          | 4.3%   |\n| Corp bond a+ | 5.19%  |\n\n### Conclusion\n\n$O is paying a better yield than corporate debt, and if rates continue to rise, we might see $O fall to match.

dividends,Dividend beer fund: How dumb of an idea is this,"Hi, I‚Äôm young, have about 12k in an aggressive Roth that I actively manage and 10K in an individual account 

I‚Äôm fairly good at picking stocks and not taking risks in the market and know that I will be making far more money in just a few years than I do now and that this decision would essentially be the equivalent of buying a car in a financial sense

I have been debating saying fuck it and writing off the 10 grand and using it as my beer fund by putting it in an aggressive monthly paying high dividend income fund like JEPI. This would give me approximately $90 a month to dick with and I can always continue adding to the fund or reinvest dividends on months I‚Äôd rather do that. 

I‚Äôm not too concerned with how others may perceive me from this, I haven‚Äôt done it yet, and I‚Äôd like some input 

At the end of the day I‚Äôll probably just keep it all in VOO like a smart person would but every day I think about this possibility

dividends,"What would you do? $1.5M in Cash, 34.","Hello,

I have cash that‚Äôs $1.5M.

I have a 401K with $100K and maxing it out, and I have an HSA with $20K.

(EDITING my sources of income/savings)

1. Income from my W2
2. Income from side businesses, I suggest you start something on Etsy and/or Amazon. Etsy is MUCH easier to create a product and sell it. Find a niche, and/or something you can do from HOME. This is key... hopefully you have time at home to do side hustles like this.
3. In the evenings or after work you can do arbitrage betting which is betting on both sides of the games and earning 1-2% edge per game. I did this and made around $50K+ cash in the first year. Including a lot from the bonuses I was able to roll over. You can see this and learn what I'm talking about. https://oddsjam.com/?ref=sweep
4. I would save money by using COUPONS, DEALS and STOCK UP when things go on sale. This is huge, I know some people don't think about it but if something is 25-30% off at the store like tissue or cleaning supplies etc.. then buy it in bulk and store it away.

I have been investing in dividends since I finished university and I am now 33 years old. 25.6% living costs coverage by dividends is a record for me, but it happened just because I had lower expenses in July 2023 - 1 160 EUR. If I look at the average expenses for the trailing 12 months, my average living expense is 2 084 EUR a month - so dividends cover \~14% in an average month.

What also has a toll on my dividend income is focusing on companies with lower dividend yields but wider MOAT recently - like Visa or Apple. As I have 49 dividend-paying companies in my portfolio, I will slowly get out of smaller positions and will make it more concentrated I think. I try to avoid selling, I am more buy-and-forget type of investor.

In terms of capital gains, SP500 beats me for a few months now. We will see how it will develop in a year or two.

dividends,Who so much ETF?,"I am starting to think I am investing ‚Äúold school‚Äù compared to what I see everyone doing with ETFs these days. It seems like so many are just dumping into ETFs and not focusing on individual companies. Is there an advantage to this that I‚Äôm not seeing here? 

I personally do research on individual companies and pick and choose where I lose my money (joking, hopefully üòÖ). ETFs are just so broad that you‚Äôre bunching losers with winners. Is it a laziness thing now? Does no one care what their money actually goes to or do the research and DD on what their hard earned money goes into?

Maybe I‚Äôm just not adapting with the current times, I‚Äôm not sure. Even people I have followed for years are swapping to more ETF and less individual investments and I just don‚Äôt get it personally. I don‚Äôt like paying a fee for someone else to bunch my money into a big basket when I can just find the (to me) best investments out of the bunch and cherry pick news events or earnings etc that drive it down.

It‚Äôs not all about the yields, it‚Äôs also about future growth and stability, and really marrying where you choose to place that money to me. But maybe I‚Äôm not seeing what others are.

Thoughts on this?

EDIT: I‚Äôm beginning to expect that using the term lazy was not the right way to approach this. I suppose I should have said easier or something along those lines. I am in no way shape or form attacking those who choose etf/funds over individual companies. The purpose of my post is to see how other people think, and maybe I learn something as well as others.

dividends,25 with ~$22K to invest + $500/month contribution. Ultimate goal is ~$100K annually in dividends,"Hello everyone. I‚Äôve been trying to build a dividend portfolio for a few years now and i‚Äôm looking to possibly completely restructure. My account is currently worth ~$22,000 and I contribute $500 every month. My ultimate goal is to be able to make ~100k a year off dividends but we‚Äôll see lol (idek if this is possible at my rate). I mostly invested in QYLD  and RYLD (360 shares each) but i‚Äôm realizing they‚Äôre kinda a waste as while the monthly dividend is fat asf i‚Äôm not actually making any money due to price fall. So I sold off all my QYLD today and plan on selling off all my RYLD once i‚Äôm able to break even on it (down $161.04). I recently got into JEPQ (100 shares) and JEPI (75 shares) but I might sell them too as i‚Äôm not using a Roth IRA. Today I also bought some SCHD (10 shares) and PLTR (ü§¶üèΩ) (160 shares). I‚Äôm kinda thinking about just doing something simple like putting the whole sum and all future contributions into VOO? Basically my question is, how would you structure a dividend portfolio starting with $22k + $500 a month (for now) with the final goal of generating $100k annually in dividends?

A DRIP is an excellent tool for long-term growth as it allows you to automatically reinvest your dividends, benefiting from the power of compounding.\r  \n\r  \nGiven your situation, here are some steps you might consider:\r  \n\r  \n1.Review Current Holdings: Before adding more funds, ensure your current investments align with your future objectives. If any dividends are from volatile or declining industries, you might reconsider their place in your portfolio.\r  \n\r  \n2.Diversification: As you invest the additional 30k, diversify across various sectors and industries. Diversification reduces risk and helps you capitalize on growth from different market segments.\r  \n\r  \n3.Growth Focus: While dividends are attractive, especially with DRIP, don't forget about growth. Given your timeline, you might want to allocate a portion of your portfolio to growth-focused investments. For instance, I recently came across the Type 3 Fund which aims at acquiring SaaS software businesses with promising revenue prospects. Their strategy also caters to individual investors looking to venture into high-tech businesses. It's just an example, but exploring such options might enhance your portfolio's growth potential.\r  \n\r  \n4.Consistent Review: The market evolves, and so will your goals. Regularly review your portfolio, say annually, to ensure you're still aligned with your investment objectives.\r  \n\r  \n5.Tax Implications: Remember that even if you're reinvesting dividends, they might still be taxable. Consult with a tax professional to understand any implications and plan accordingly.\r  \n\r  \n6,Emergency Fund: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside. Investing is fantastic, but having liquid assets for unexpected expenses is crucial.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's essential to do your own research or consult with a financial advisor before making any decisions.

Over time, I\'ve become really good at utilizing Fidelity\'s ""FidFolio"" feature, which I believe stands out as the most sophisticated tool available in the brokerage market currently.\n\nAt its core, FidFolio tool allows me in building a basket of stocks or positions. My approach involves using ETF Screener to identify a maximum of 50 ETFs.While some of them might overlap, my primary focus remains on those with a consistent high yield and positive performance across 5-year, 3-year, and year-to-date metrics. After picking these ETFs, I add them to a watchlist. With FidFolio\'s capabilities, I can allocate a specific amount, say $1,500, uniformly across these selected stocks, ensuring each receives 2% of the total investment.\n\nAdditionally, I\'ve devised a strategy involving two trading windows: the market\'s opening and mid-day. This approach allows me to take advantage of high trading volumes in the morning or to seize opportunities mid-day when stocks are either stablized or declining.\n\nA significant advantage of FidFolio is its ""target allocation"" feature. For instance, if out of my 50 stocks, five are underperforming, I can introduce an additional sum, like $40, into the FidFolio. The platform then buys the stocks and allocates these funds to stocks that have drifted below their target, enabling me to ""buy the dip"". This strategy also works the same when selling stocks as well where I can sell the stocks that have diftted in the postive direction efficively capturing my gains.\n\nIt\'s important to note that while this methodology suits me, it may not work with everyone, especially those who might not be inclined to manage an extensive number of stocks (200+).\n\nMy personal investment philosophy is centered around not purchasing individual company stocks directly, unless through an ETF or a managed fund.\n\nI think that a diversified portfolio by using multiple ETFs inherently means a greater number of companies potentially working in my favor and with FidFolio it facilitates the tracking of these investments I do, offering segmented insights into profits and losses, all feeding into my overarching portfolio.\n\nI hope that my approach some what helps you.', 'VTI is essential as you will zero exposure to the world ex-US without it. \n\nThe US share of global market cap is expected to decline from roughly 62% currently to well less than 50% by 2050. \n\nSince there is overlap between VTI, SPY, and QQQ I would counter with equal thirds to:\n\nVTI SCHD And QQM']"

This is different, and far more relevant than its distribution yield.\n\nSo, the fund assets earn 9.6%. For what amount of risk?\n\nThe credit quality breakdown is available online. With this, we can estimate a default risk based on historical defaults for each credit rating. Given the high interest rate environment, I moderately increased these for CCC and B rated debt.\n\nThe calculated default risk is just over 9%. However, historical recovery rates are 60%. So, the default risk after recovery comes to 3.7%.\n\n9.6% portfolio yield minus 3.7% default risk = 5.9%\n\nBlackrock charges a management fee of 1.25% and other expenses total .74%. The gross expense ratio is 1.99%\n\n9.6% minus 3.7% minus 1.99% equals 3.95%. This is the risk-adjusted yield. The risk premium (to treasuries, and to investment grade debt) is negative. Investors are bearing excessive risk which do not fairly compensate for the default risks based on historical rates, net of recovery.\n\nSo, what should we own?\n\nAlthough I am weary of all high yield debt as I expect spreads to widen, $HYT (also managed by Blackrock) fared much more favorably in my analysis. $HYT offers investors a risk-adjusted yield of 6.5%. This is below historical spreads for high yield, but obviously a premium to treasuries.\n\n$PHK also comes out looking better, although the portfolio is more difficult to analyze, so the adjusted yield of 6.9% has a sizable error range.\n\nOn the investment grade side, $BINC fares well under scrutiny. Adjusted yield exceeds 6%.\n\nBetter than all of these may be $JAAA and $JBBB. The portfolios yield 7.4% and 10% (gross) respectively, or 7.28% and 9.5% net of fees.\n\nThe funds invest in AAA and BBB CLOs. I highly recommend the ""insights"" and fund documents on the JAAA fund page on Janus Henderson\'s website.\n\nEssentially, hundreds of private bank loans are pooled into a security, and then sliced into tranches. The AAA tranche receives priority of all cash flows. In any case of distress, AAA gets paid first. No AAA CLO has EVER defaulted in 30 years. This includes the GFC. The 7.28% true yield is very high for AAA rated debt. This is because the CLO debt is all floating rate. That means the interest rates on the loans change immediately when the fed funds rate changes. Hence, they are perfect for a rising rate environment. Their 7.28% yield, in my opinion, reflects both some fear (unwarranted regarding AAAs) and expectations for rate cuts.\n\nRegarding JBBB. The BBB CLO tranche stands junior to A/AA and AAA tranches, but senior to the equity tranche, and B/BB tranche. They will be paid after higher rated debt, and it is possible to see defaults. The historical default rate for BBB-rated CLOs is .01%. The highest annual default rate I believe was .12%. Given the macro environment, it can be argued that some risk exists here.\n\nCLO spreads (relative to treasuries and to corporate debt) are wide today compared to historical averages/ The market is pricing in rate cuts. Unlike fixed rate debt with effective duration typically between 3 and 7 years, floating rate debt does not benefit from rate cuts. Neither is it punished, however. Since there is zero duration, there is no interest rate risk.\n\nIn my opinion, these offer the best RISK-ADJUSTED yield in the market. 7.28% for ZERO risk in JAAA is compelling. I own 1,000 shares. The ""downside"" is that \\*IF the fed cuts next year, JAAA will yield only 7%, then 6.75%, then 6.5%. The spread to treasuries will persist nonetheless.\n\nJBBB pays a beautiful 9.5% for historically minimal risk. Comparing this to $BIT, whose portfolio yields 9.6% (before fees), but carries significant default risk. 14% of $BIT is in CCC rated debt, and another 6% is in CC rated debt! And 32% in B rated debt! $BIT\'s adjusted yield is closer to 4%.\n\nSo, the opportunity to earn a true 9.5% on 100% BBB (in fact, around 6% of JBBB is actually A-rated) is remarkable to me. While my position in JAAA is far larger, my high-yield allocation is going entirely to JBBB, and not to BIT.\n\n**TLDR: $BIT\'s distribution yield of 10.2% is a trick, because the portfolio YTM is only 9.6%. After adjusting for default risks and fees, $BIT yields LESS than treasuries with far more uncertainty. HYT, PHK, and BINC are better. CLO funds JAAA and JBBB offer remarkable risk-adjusted yields of 7.28% and 9.5%.**', 'Always state age with JEPI so community can decide to get rabid or not.', 'FSCO', 'Look into CEFs if you want to juice yields and diversify even further into an under appreciated asset class.

dividends,Stock Holdings Of 6 Popular Dividend Funds,"I was curious about the top holdings of popular dividend funds so I did a little research.  I don't know how important the results are but since I did the work, I thought I would post just in case there are those that might be interested.  I took six funds, SPHD, VIG, VYM, PEY, SCHD and DGRO.  I used the percentage of each holding for all funds to come up with a list of the most held stocks.  This is not real scientific but I took each stock held by at least one fund, summed the percentages held by all funds, found the minimum held by any fund, the maximum held by any fund and the number of funds holding it.  I realize that the results are based on percentages of different sized funds but it was an attempt to find what stocks were most important to the most funds.  You decide if there is any worth to this data.

dividends,Bought 2538 shares of TSLY this week to see how it goes.,"Running an experiment with TSLY.  Bought 2538 shares at a basis of $13.79 to see how well these funds actually work.

I've made $1k in capital appreciation so far, which is emotionally reassuring, but meaningless.  My buy case:

* I'm a believer in Tesla over the long term.
* Tesla volatility is insane.  It's not a meme stock, but has almost that level of obsession over it.  People trading in and out all the time.
* Saw an article that says ""TSLY is not how to play Tesla.""  I disagree.  If it's going to be that volatile, may as well profit off the volatility, instead of seeing your paper gains erased over and over again.  But then, I'm into dividends, so there's that.
* Reinvesting the dividends into other assets.  So for the first 18 months - 2 years, the functional effect is that I sold my previous position to DCA into the assets I'm reinvesting into.  Only once TSLY has paid back it's investment am I really seeing much difference from a DCA (ignoring whatever paper gains or losses TSLY experiences.)
* Curious how much (if any) share price erosion will occur over the next 2 years.  TSLY had a big drop shortly after release tied to the drop in Tesla.  But that's not the same as erosion, which you would get with a \*YLD fund.

I think I'll be ok, so long as Tesla does ok.  If it doesn't well, from where I sit, there's not much difference in risk between buying this and an equivalent amount of TSLA.

Anyway, wish me luck!  Hoping that after 18 months to 2 years, TSLY will have paid for itself in other assets, and I'll still have a valuable asset in TSLY generating significant income.  But we'll have to see how it works out.

EDIT:  The account I bought this in was an IRA containing the rollover of my 401k from my previous employer.  I can't contribute to this account, since I'm contributing to a Roth.  But my thinking was hopefully this is a way of getting some ""stealth contributions"" to the account, from income return on investments.  Hoping for $1500 - $2000 per month in dividends.  Which is WAY more than I could get from any other income investment.","['Welcome to r/dividends!\n\nIf you are new to the world of dividend investing and are seeking advice, brokerage information, recommendations, and more, please check out the Wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/wiki/faq).\n\nRemember, this is a subreddit for genuine, high-quality discussion.

Theoretically TSLY should outperform TSLA in a down or sideways trading period and underperform in an upward trend.

Hi Fellow Div Enthusiasts, 

Been reading here for a while.  I am 53, wife 52. I have a taxable E-Trade account with about 18k in it in the following stocks. JEPI, JEPQ, ABR, KRP, ET, QYLD, TSLY, NVDY and MPW. I am earning $2283 a year in this account in dividends so far.  Just started putting any real money in this account in May.  Most of this account is in JEPQ, JEPI, ABR, and KRP.  The rest is in the others. I have about 2-3k per month from my job to invest and have been putting that much in since May.  Goal is to hit 20k per month in Div like account belonging to Dividend Dreamer on Youtube. On this account I also sell weekly  .10 to .20 Delta Puts and Calls on RIVN, MPW, PLTR, UAA, and FSR.  I have been doing well at that since I started in May, earning 68% of account value annualized in May and June, while flat in August (been rough month).

Question is I just started a Roth IRA for both my wife and I and intend to max out both by April 15th next year ($7500 in each) and every year after.  I also intend to put whatever I have left and whatever I can scrounge into taxable account.  What would be the best stocks to put in Roth IRA's and taxable account from here till then to accomplish this goal in 20 years?  I would be 73.

Would like to hear all options!","['Welcome to r/dividends!\n\nIf you are new to the world of dividend investing and are seeking advice, brokerage information, recommendations, and more, please check out the Wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/wiki/faq).\n\nRemember, this is a subreddit for genuine, high-quality discussion.

At your current yield of 18.73%, you would need about $1.3mil to achieve that amount, at a 10% yield you would need about $2.4mil, and at a 5% yield you would need about $4.8mil.\n\nWith your current account balance of $18k and your current monthly savings rate of $2-3k, assuming an annual growth rate of 10%, it would take roughly 16-19 years to hit about $1.3mil, roughly 21-25 years to hit around $2.4mil, and roughly 28-31 years to hit about $4.8mil.\n\nIf we were to assume that your current yield of 18.73% is also your annual growth rate (when price fluctuations are taken into account), then those timeframes would shrink to 12-14 years, 15-17 years, and 19-21 years, respectively.\n\nIf things were to go a little slower, at say a 5% annual growth rate, then it would be 21-26 years, 30-36 years, and 41-49 years, respectively.\n\nAs for the best way to achieve those numbers, I can't tell you. I just wanted to see what it would take to achieve that goal, and figured I'd share the math.\n\nEdit: Looking at more realistic numbers, the historic rule for retirement withdrawals is 4% annually, and the SPY has a CAGR of 10% - so we'll use those two as our yield and benchmark growth rate.

It would be nice if they benchmarked their total returns against a more conventional portfolio such as a Boglehead 3 fund portfolio with a similar risk profile.\n\nI'm a heavy dividend investor and have a similar sized portfolio, but my income is just 40K per year, however, my total returns are averaging around 150K because I get over 100K in growth too.

dividends,"Ye I get it robinhood sucks, but so do the alternatives","So a little while ago, I made a portfolio review post. I was so happy because I'd been saving up all the money I'd made in my part-time job before I turned 18 so that when I turned 18, I have this massive cash reserve I can put into the market, bonds, and other stuffs. I remember when I posted it, a lot of people told me that robinhood isn't a real ""brokerage."" So I said, okay I'll switch to Schwab. IT IS SO CONFUSING AND UNINTUITIVE. Placing an order is so much more complicated, which is probably fine for people who have a much higher risk tolerance and aren't just putting their money in a few ETFs, BUT NOT ME! I also don't understand why I can't buy fractional shares of an ETF. I make $12K a year on a good year, I AM A CHILD, I don't have money to buy 7 shares of VOO, and I don't everything in VOO. I want some money in international stocks as well, but NOOOOO I have to buy a full share to do anything. Also recently, I had to sell some stocks to pay for a big bill I got from school, SCHWAB MAKES IT SO HARD TO WITHDRAW UR MONEY. I have a little bit of cash available and then the rest of my cash which came from the stocks I just sold are considered ""borrowed cash."" So when I tried to transfer it to my checking account, it said I didn't have enough money to transfer. I JUST SOLD 2 SHARES OF VOO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DONT HAVE ENOUGH TO TRANSFER. So maybe Robinhood isn't so shit after all, especially for people like me, who are poor and don't have 5 figure portfolios.

dividends,"Idiot ""Investor"" trying to be Smarter - Need Advice","Hello. I'm 31 years old and I started ""investing/speculating/gambling"" in late 2020. I didn't really get serious about it though until early 2022. Looking for a little advice from you all.

**A little intro:**

Initially, I thought investing was about finding some good companies, riding the train up (mostly down in my case), and then selling for profit, (again, mostly losses). I was an idiot in terms of investing, I know. But I've never really heard much about investing, jumped into the Robinhood hype train, and learned my lessons. Luckily, nothing was awful but lost money is lost money. No bueno. Heck, I was even involved in the whole First Republic Bank disaster... could've had a solid profit but ultimately sold for a loss... in other news, the sky is blue.

At the beginning of this year, I finally started to get smarter about it. Reading books, articles, and anything else educational I can get my hands on. 

My current holdings include:

* VOO
* SCHD 
* QQQM 
* PLTR

Why PLTR - I leave 5% of my portfolio as ""fun"" money to try my luck with. In this case, PLTR makes up 3.29% of my holdings. I know PLTR is down almost 9% today but I have hopes for this one long-term, so it's funny I'm writing this post now showing off my holdings in them. The rest of my money is locked into those ETFs. Time will tell...

Below is a Portfolio X-Ray but you may want to note that AMZN is not actually as big in **MY** portfolio. I recently took control of my wife's brokerage account so it's linked to my whole portfolio story. She bought a bunch of Amazon a while back. With its recent earnings report, I'm going to hold it until the end of the year and then sell it (either for tax purposes or a profit <-- ( holdings are down -17%)) and put it all into VOO for her. At this point, she's only in SCHD and VOO (plus her shares of AMZN)

If you're still reading - thank you! I promise we're almost done.

I want to get more into dividend investing. American Express, Visa, Kroger, Abbvie, etc - all those nice big names that can help me retire earlier. I want that snowball effect and just feed the dividend beast.

**Question 1:** Now with me investing in SCHD and VOO - what's the point in going for additional individual stocks? For example, 2 shares of Abbvie pay around $10 annually. 2 Shares of Abbvie are also worth about 4 shares of SCHD = around $10 annually.

*  What's the point in going the route with individual companies? Is there a benefit other than diversification? Aren't I already diversified through SCHD and VOO?
* At which point to add individual companies on top of SCHD and VOO?
* Once/If the point of adding individual companies comes - do you add ones that aren't represented in SCHD or VOO?

**Question 2:** I read that growth investing is better for young people. 2 questions arise for me

1. At what age then do you switch over to an only dividend portfolio if you do growth investing?
2. How bad would you get taxed if you have your current full-time job, as well as dividend income?
3. Do people do both; dividend and growth investing?

I'm only at a $112 dividend income per year but I was pumped when I breached my first $100!

Do your investing in a Roth IRA or Ira account. You can‚Äôt take the money out until retirement (although there are ways to withdraw for a first home purchase or emergencies if need be, with stipulations) this way you‚Äôll have the best tax treatment. You can always have a mix of both growth and dividend stocks. Dividend income increases as your portfolio grows, so it may make sense to go for growth when you‚Äôre younger and then shift to dividends when your account is large enough that the dividend payments are substantial. In any case, when you‚Äôre young make sure you automatically reinvest any dividends (drip).', ""Question 1 really hinges on personal preference. Holding individual stocks can make the process of investing more interesting, but there is lots of research pointing to there being no evidence that the average investor can beat the market by picking individual stocks. To me this means there is no real benefit but also no real harm in picking individual stocks, provided that the number of stocks purchased is sufficient to shield the investor from ruin if one or two picks turn out to be duds. 30-50 stocks selected over a diverse number of market sectors should be sufficient. Though with that large a number of holdings it's nearly impossible to stay abreast of important news impacting each company. Once you hit the point where you have enough companies to reduce individual company risk to a reasonable level you just have to ask yourself if you'd be better off with a good ETF or mutual fund with a selection criteria that matches your own personal preferences.\n\nQuestion 2 is an easier one to answer. The commonly heard advice that a young investor should show a preference towards growth stocks is based upon tax considerations. If investing outside of an IRA or 401k it is true that dividends are taxed (if your combined taxable income exceeds certain thresholds), which will create a tax drag on growth. The theory goes that the investor can invest in growth stocks when young, pay less in taxes along the way, and then sell those positions down in retirement at a much lower tax rate (maybe even zero). OK. That sounds reasonable. But if investing in a 401k or IRA this is a non-issue. Taxes are only paid at the end (for traditional 401k and IRA accounts) or at the beginning (Roth). There are no taxes paid on capital gains or dividends in the mean-time. So a young investor can pick growth or value in a retirement account and in the long run it won't make much of a difference (growth and value tend to cycle in terms of which does better over a span of years). Outside of a tax sheltered account you'll find that after a few years you can get locked into your choice. Consider what happens over a period of 10 years. Maybe the value of your portfolio doubles. That means that selling a position will incur a tax on 50% of the nominal value of the sale. That can be a pretty big penalty. John Bogle himself said that one of the reasons Vanguard split their market funds into growth and value was to give an investor the option of holding value funds in a tax sheltered account and growth in a non-qualified account (regular brokerage account). Doing both sounds like a reasonable approach. For myself personally, I have taken the 100% value stock approach in both tax sheltered and non-sheltered accounts. The reason I wanted the dividend payers in my brokerage, even though I'd pay a 15% tax on dividends during my working years, is that I wanted to retire prior to age 59.5 and needed to have income producing assets available to me. I retired 2 years ago at age 50 and currently enjoy the freedom the income stream provides me. I can spend the dividends and not have to worry about depleting my portfolio because I don't have to sell shares.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck!"", 'Thanks for the vote of confidence in the portfolio. I feel much more confident in it now as well. QQQM is my growth focused one that I‚Äôll keep alongside VOO and SCHD to gain more exposure into the tech market. \nAnd yes, beating the market has been incredibly difficult, if not impossible for me. Which is why I have resorted to changing my tactic to my current approach. By the time I‚Äôm 60, it would be okay to only own VOO and SCHD for example? Or should I aim to have individual stocks as well? I know the answer can go both ways, but what would you do?', '> the issue with picking individual stocks is that most people can‚Äôt beat the market by picking stocks\n\nThat\'s boglehead dogma, but backwards when dividend investing. Not only do dividend stocks make predicting future performance much easier, but picking individual stocks is the way to higher performance.

Growth companies sometimes pay dividends. The dividend yield of VUG (Vanguard Growth Index) is currently 0.5%, and historically has been 1.0-1.5%. Not all value companies pay dividends.\n\nGrowth/value don\'t mean what most new investors think they mean - growth doesn\'t mean ""high return, high risk"" companies and value doesn\'t mean ""low return, low risk"" companies. Similarly, dividend companies are not inherently low risk. Growth means companies that are valued more for their future earnings than their current earnings (ie, they are expected to grow in the future). Value means companies that are priced low with respect to their intrinsic value.\n\nIf you look historically, the returns of value companies have actually been somewhat higher than growth companies. Similarly, in the last 20 years, ""dividend aristocrat"" companies have returned nearly the same as the broader large cap market - this is not a surprise, given most large cap companies are dividend aristocrats.\n\nThis is a long-ish answer to say - don\'t make assumptions about how investments perform by their names. Investment companies like to advertise ""aggressive growth"" because it sounds like something folks who are risk-tolerant and want massive returns should invest in. In reality, most investment companies have little to no idea what future returns to expect from their funds.', 'Growth and dividend can go be done at the same time.

But I will need the 21k right away when I do. 

I have a few options with this money. Give me your thoughts. 

I could pay for all it part of the car with that 21k. 

However, I could just make this a strong dividend focused portfolio and make payments out of my normal salary and then add the dividends every month (if I get monthly). That would help pay off a loan faster. 

I could also just make it an income generated focused dividend portfolio and have some extra cash every month to spend on whatever as long as I have access to the 21k. 

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that I don‚Äôt need to grow the money, so I may as well just milk it in the mean time. 

Thoughts? Again, I don‚Äôt need this for retirement or the future. Just need to milk it for a few months up to 2 years.

dividends,Retiring on ETFs like VOO/VTI,"Hi,

I am relatively new to long term investing and have been building a dividend portfolio for about 6 months now.

I have a question about retiring on ETFs like VOO/VTI. Is the idea to keep selling some shares and live off that? If yes, what makes it sustainable? 

Dividend ETFs are intuitive to me. That is, build a big enough portfolio and live off dividends and keep adding a portion of dividend back to portfolio.

Any insight would be helpful. Apologies if this is not the right forum to ask this question.

dividends,What stocks are on your watch list?,"EDIT: I'M REALLY ASKING FOR BUY LIST ITEMS HERE, NOT WATCH LIST (as pointed out to me) 


The markets are just coming off from an near  all-time-high, and the majority of stocks is still hugely inflated with multiples like 31 even for PEP which seems ridiculous for a company that basically cannot grow much further unless it hugely branches out.

The markets seem to be detached from the real economy, with highly-leveraged companies such as TSLA jumping higher even on FED rate increases.

It's ok, I can wait this out. But in the mean time I'm trying to find beaten down stocks that are actually at an attractive price level now. We all read the stories for instance that the NASDAQ-100 30% melt-up is mainly caused by the price increase of FAANGM. The same for other indices.

So I'm trying to look behind the index-curtain to see some fairly prices stocks of good companies. One stock that I openen a position in last week was O (10 shares @ 56.95). 

Yes, many will say that Incan get the similar 5% return in a risk-free MM account or T-Bills but those have no capital appreciation and my thesis is that O will fairly quickly go back into the $65-70 range once interest rates stabalize or even decline. I'm hoping in the mean time - say over the past 18 months - to build a good position, DCA-ing from $57 and lower (if this happens). My personal goals is to acquire an amount of O that gives me $100 in dividends per month and then just let that ride until eternity.

I am looking for other positions too. Stocks that are now fair or even cheaply priced; that are of good companies with a long dividend-paying history and that show growth over time as well.

So apart from the MSFTs, JPMs, PEPs that we might all be eyeballing for when  the markts oulls back significantly, what stocks are you bying now?

I'd like to get your ideas; perhaps with a brief thesis, so that I can research further.","['Welcome to r/dividends!\n\nIf you are new to the world of dividend investing and are seeking advice, brokerage information, recommendations, and more, please check out the Wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/wiki/faq).\n\nRemember, this is a subreddit for genuine, high-quality discussion.

Companies that trade at high P/E multiples are often growing profits on a consistent basis.

My point is: you cannot make investing decisions just based on P/E. \n\nSimilarly, companies reaching ATH are doing so because investors are optimistic about the future.

I plan to reinvest the income from there and not contribute any more of my own money to it. Hopefully compound interest will do the work going forward. I wanted to make this account in case I got laid off or needed extra money at the end of the month. If I don‚Äôt have to pull from it then I can use it for retirement since I'm not sure social security will still be around in 25 years. I appreciate any comments or suggestions.

I never understand why people respond to threads in a dividend sub, bitching that you shouldn't want dividends.\n\nDifferent dividend holdings serve different purposes. JEPI and JEPQ have a skewed capture ratio, which basically means if the econony is crap and the market is crap, that is the time when their per-share div payments are the best... which gives you a little protection from other div holdings having div cuts in response to economic conditions.  They are good for that, DIVO probably is as well.\n\nNo div holding is perfect, nothing is good in all scenarios. So the other holdings should suit other scenarios.\n\nIDVO is the sister fund to DIVO. Unfortunately lower volume so higher fees, but I suspect that will improve if it becomes more popular. The reason for this one? International divs, which hedges you a little against USD going down relative to the other major currencies and resulting in import inflation.\n\nSCHD and similar, have a lower yield but play well to a long bull market where interest rates are drifting down. Also here your divs are fully qualified, so you don't pay taxes until you hit your annual limit. DIVO is decent for that as well, I think 50% qualified divs.\n\nREITs are a subtle space but worth adding on quality holdings whenever that sector has been in the read for awhile. You'll get your yield numbers here, but stock price could be a rollercoaster for the next few years, and at times you will see div cuts for a little while. Avoid mortgage REITs; they get hyped a lot but can be totally shredded in a sustained recession as the only assets they hold are in paper.\n\nSo basically my advice is to only look at the yield second, not first. Understand *why* you add each holding. Create a portfolio based on understanding, not just the yield.\n\nBlended all together, you'll probably end up with something netting a stable 6 to 7 percent, no more. Anything more and you're at risk of constructing a bad portfolio unless you are a much better than average stock picker and market timer.\n\nTo make up the difference in that versus your target, you need to either increase the investment, or find a secondary income stream. \n\nDon't box yourself into a bad plan by setting a goal not well-suited suited to the investment you have chosen. Make a good plan, and accept when it reaches its limits."", 'Are your holdings in the right?  The watchlist?  Or the stocks on the bottom?', 'The income portion of my portfolio is very similar to yours. I do mostly the S&P 500 in my retirement accounts. I had gone for growth in my brokerage account for years and recently decided to split it in half, continue for growth with half and go for income with half. On the income side I have SCHD, BST, DIVO, and GOF. \n\nI look at GOF as the high income anchor with extremely consistent distributions while the other three have potential for capital appreciation and dividend growth since GOF lacks both. \n\nI had considered other high yield CEFs including CLM and PDI on your list but just went with GOF as my top choice for the high yield portion. Probably nothing wrong with spreading the funds out across a few of them like you have. I had also considered JEPI/Q. I don‚Äôt like how the distributions fluctuate so much since it‚Äôs from option premiums. I wanted more consistent income. Also, since they‚Äôre new I looked to the original fund JEPIX with longer history and didn‚Äôt like how it has performed. If you haven‚Äôt checked it out already, UTG might be a good option. Its yield is right around the target yield for JEPI/Q and it has a long history of actually being able to produce gains and dividend growth. It was on my list as well but I ultimately went with my top 4 choices. \n\nOverall I like this strategy, since it is eerily similar to my own lol, but if this is the entirety of your brokerage account you might do well with adding at least one small holding focused on growth. This portfolio will have a lower beta so you might be bummed out if you see the market taking off and you miss out. My brokerage account is about the same size and I do half in this strategy and half for growth. Even if you are committed to this strategy for income, I don‚Äôt think it would hurt to add a small position to increase the overall portfolio beta.', 'ET', 'I dislike most of these for a long term hold.  You‚Äôll pay a lot in fees and in taxes.\n\nYou‚Äôll very likly get the same long term results with simpliler funds (schd/voo) without paying for a fund managers yacht.\n\nThen, if you actually need income in 20 years you can rejig your portfolio', '2k a month on 200k is going to be impossible without risk.', ""What were your criteria for selecting these?

dividends,Investing $300-$1200 a week,"I‚Äôve maxed my Roth IRA (FZROX, FZILX, JEPQ) for the year so I sell CCs in my main account. Not sure whether to keep the JEPQ or not. I have 101.5 shares so I‚Äôm getting almost one share a month from the DIV so far which seems great to me.

Realistically, depending on if the call gets exercised I get about 300-1200 a week and those funds just get rolled into next weeks buy. I usually pick some volatile stocks so the premium is decent, plus the call getting exercised. 

I‚Äôd like to start throwing those funds into some juicy DIVs for my main account. 

Obviously yeah ‚Äúwhy come to Reddit for advice‚Äù because I value other people‚Äôs opinions and to see what they‚Äôre getting themselves into.

dividends,Done gambling,"So I've tried my hand at investing in stocks but it just feels like gambling to me. Mostly because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing or how to do proper DD. I've picked some winners and some losers. Mostly losers tbh. I'd like to be able to supplement my income in retirement so dividends seems like a good choice.

So here's the deal. Im 33, currently unemployed by choice doing the stay at home dad thing while my new baby is too young/wife doesn't want to have him go to daycare/school. I'm 100% P&T from the VA so I make about 4.3k a month from that and will for the rest of my life (assuming the government doesn't cut benefits or some other fuckery happens). I can invest anywhere from $500 - 1k a month. I've got a Roth IRA but it's with the acorns app and they kinda just pick things for you to invest in depending on how aggressive you want to be.

dividends,8 Months Update,"Went from \~1,100 to \~4,600. 1,000 of that is still in cash. Set up daily buy of VTI an SCHD. Recently bought in AAPL and MSFT, though it is a pretty much non existent at the moment. I thought that purely dividend at this time would be not advised so I added them for growth opportunities.

Currently 20 in college Computer science, My goal for 2023 was to reach 5k total by the end of the year, but I think I can make it to 6 or 7.

I plan to have 10k by the end of 2024, but I've been doing better than I thought so I think that might bump up to 15k if I can find a good job next summer. Have to work hard for that. I'll let the daily buys ride out until for a while like this. I don't want to make things too complicated for myself.

This is mainly an update for myself, but advice and thoughts are welcome.

 Tiny Update : Today's paycheck just cleared, made it to my yearly goal. I have one more paycheck from this summer job before I go back to school. That one should bump me up to 6k!

dividends,How would you start dividend investing with the benefit of hindsight?,"I would start with ETFs rather than single stocks as this is a rapid and easy was to get diversification and is a passive approach.

I would buy top tier beloved investments like SCHD instead of garbage.

I would also have a concentrated portfolio early on.

When you don‚Äôt have a lot of income I think it‚Äôs more satisfying to have a concentrated portfolio of one or two ETFs and set a goal to grow those until they generate enough income to buy 1 more of themselves. Then every quarter thereafter you can throw that money back in and have a compounding snowball in motion.

Otherwise you end up with several sporadic micro payments coming in.

The satisfaction when you have an investment that can buy itself is wonderful.","['Welcome to r/dividends!\n\nIf you are new to the world of dividend investing and are seeking advice, brokerage information, recommendations, and more, please check out the Wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/wiki/faq).\n\nRemember, this is a subreddit for genuine, high-quality discussion.

""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday called for more vigilance in the fight against inflation, warning that additional interest rate increases could be yet to come.

While acknowledging that progress has been made, the central bank leader said inflation is still above where policymakers feel comfortable. ""

Having listened to Powell's speech, he mainly pointed out that core PCE inflation is still too high at 4.1%. While headline inflation is lower right now at 3%, as soon as energy (or food) prices would go higher again, something you can expect going into winter, also headline inflation will go higher again if core inflation doesn't push back against it.

**So expect more hikes. Energy prices will move higher towards winter and if core doesn't come down drastically, overall inflation will stay high or move even higher. That's what Powell was basically referring to. His preferred indicator is core PCE minus housing.**

**Note:** Fed's own Nowcasting shows **PCE for August at +0,6%**, way above the number for July even when adding some room for error with their forecast.

Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday, reporting iPhone sales that missed analysts' expectations while **revenue fell 1.4% over last year, the third straight quarter of declines.** About half of the company's overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment.  
  
On Friday, Apple stock was down 2% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it's share price decline.  
  
Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.  
  
Services did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do?

investing,I feel devastated and surprised by the likely accidental wrongful marketing of ‚Äúput money aside monthly and Watch it grow into millions‚Äù,"First, I know it will grow into million. Compounding interest and the raising water of index funds is undeniable truth. 

My shock and disappointment is in a nuance that was never mentioned amongst friends, most forums, and lots of finance books. 

So, my situation models after a typical decent American household and would be considered extra good for rest of the world. 

I‚Äôm 32 with a Household income after taxes of 60,000$

Set aside 20% every month into a IRA & Roth = 12,000/year

I plug that into a compounding calculator for 30 years with an average return of 9% (roughly a 50-100 year historical average) 

= boom 1,700,000$ 

I am rich!!!! Thank god I didn‚Äôt buy those Starbucks coffees everyday and invested it instead. 

But wait‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs guarantee in life: death, taxes, and inflation. 

1.7m in 30 years will not actually be 1.7m dollars today. 

Even worse, inflation compounds just as my interest on investments does. 

So an inflation calculator shows in 30 years ‚Äú This is an average inflation rate of -2.50% and cumulative inflation of -52.33%.‚Äù 

Meaning my 1.7m is actually 850,000$ when adjusted for inflation. 

Then 4% is a safe withdrawal rate of the 850k (inflation adjusted) = 34,000$ (and there will be a ~5% effective federal tax rate as married on the IRA withdrawal at least)

So my 20% saving rate(1k/m), with great 9% average returns, over 30 years with a tax deferred IRA/Roth account will result in ~2700$/m when adjusted for inflation. (Roughly half of my net income)

Now this isn‚Äôt bad, and paired with US social security, it is realistic 70-90% of my net income will be maintained in retirement. Great!

""The U.S. Federal Reserve will likely need to raise interest rates further to bring down inflation, Governor Michelle Bowman said on Saturday.

Bowman said she supported the Fed's quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices.

""I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC‚Äôs 2 percent target,"" she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed's rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.""

Data from last Friday also seems to underpin this:

Metric	Actual	(Estimate) :

* Unemployment rate: **3.5%**	 (3.6%)
* Average hourly earnings (MoM): **+0.4%**	(+0.3%)

So unemployment dropped back to 3.5% and wage growth added 0.4% which was above estimate. Keep in mind that Powell and the Fed pay alot of attention to those 2 specific metrics.

Also [Fed's own Nowcasting](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting) projects CPI +0.4% for the month of July (which is above the current estimate of 0.2%) and even **+0,6% for the month of August.**

There was clearly a clean energy bubble coinciding with a growth stock bubble peaking around 2021, followed by a substantial correction for both. I know rising rates haven't helped either, since a lot of solar companies have future cash flows now heavily discounted.

The simple is this with GoodLeap for instance; the largest solar finance company in the nation.

investing,Thinking of putting 60% of my net worth in the S&P 500,"I'm a recent graduate with a full time job and my parents are pretty well off financially. But its nothing ridiculous. They have been supportive of me financially as well growing up and I've had a bank account with a small allowance that I never really indulged with because it was my understanding it was theirs not mine.

investing,In Defense of Dividends (On a Million $ Portfolio),"To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:

[https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/c1c6c8X.jpg)

Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.

Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.

As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.

Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about ""young"" investors chasing dividends: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why\_are\_many\_especially\_young\_people\_investing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/15d7p3e/why_are_many_especially_young_people_investing_in/)

While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.

**The Arguments for Dividends**

*1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*

No investor thinks that dividends are ""free money"". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a ""gotcha"", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?

No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.

*2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*

At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:

a) What is my income stream?

b) How fast is that income stream growing?

Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:

**""His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year""**

In his book ""The Four Pillars of Investing"", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.

For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.

*3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*

For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.

*4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*

Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?

Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.

For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.

*5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*

When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky ""trust me bro"" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.

*6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*

The English used to have a saying:

**""Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!""**

People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.

For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.

*7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*

Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.

Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.

*8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*

What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.

What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.

*9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*

The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:

Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.

For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.

**Bottom Line**

No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.

That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.

investing,Investing 100k cautiously in this market.,"I've been slacking on getting better about investing for the last few years as my salary has increased.  I have been maxing Roth IRA and contributing up to match on 401k(I'm thinking about maxing this as well).  I have about 136k in retirement accounts.

I'm at the point where I know I'm just being triggershy and losing money/time so I need to make some decisions.

I have around 140k in cash which is just getting eaten into by inflation and I'm not currently using a high yield savings account.

I'm tentatively planning on moving 40k to a HYSA as an emergency fund, it's a bit more than 6 months of expenses but I'm in tech and the sector is kind of unstable right now.

I've been thinking of just putting the rest in VTI/VSUX and letting it sit(I'm 37) - I shouldn't need it until retirement, and then contributing any income above what I need to keep that emergency fund around ~40k as it comes in.

I'm a little apprehensive as I read a lot of concerns about a recession but I also understand the argument for time in the market vs timing the market.

I don't have any debt other than my mortgage and make a little over 200k.

NVIDIA charges a hefty premium for VRAM, which constrain how big a model can run on a GPU card. Their A100 can have 40-80 Gb VRAM and starts at $14k if you find a deal. These are the cards needed to run chatGPT style models. Because of the bottleneck, most of the cost of an A100 is profit to NVIDIA, thus their accelerating market share.  \n\nAMD offers one GPU model (W7900) with 48 Gb VRAM for a fraction around $4k. At some point it is going to be cost effective for developers to switch if NVIDIA keeps profit gouging. But [based on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/wbdq5c/d_rocm_vs_cuda) AMD has to get serious about making the codebase work with all their cards and be easier for users to switch. But it is a solvable problem.', ""It depends on what we're talking about. For gaming, they are pretty similar. But for the data center space Nvidia enjoys a significant advantage due to their hardware architecture (GPU, CPU, and DPU), CUDA ecology, and significant existing talent and libraries to jumpstart development."", 'AMD is competing with Intel in the CPU market and seems to be taking the lead. With Nvidia AMD competes in the GPU market (Intel GPU attempts are negligible) and on the hardware side AMD is nearly as good as Nvidia. For gaming for the same price you can get equally good products from both. Where AMD is lacking is the software that supports use of their GPUs in data centres, machine learning and generally AI field. Nvidia is entrenched with their software and even if AMD sells equally good hardware the cost of switching to a different software architecture (which also may be not as good at the moment) will be prohibitive. Until AMD solves this problem Nvidia will be the leader.']"
investing,"Starting from absolute $0 ($1,000) at 31","This is embarrassing but I am choosing to own it and move forward. I know it is not legal to give financial advice potentially even through discussions online but I thought it was worth a shot. 

Basically I am a recovered addict. I used to work in finance as a mortgage broker, e-commerce underwriter etc. but I fell into bad habits and although I was working since fourteen I was never able to save due to ADHD/CPTSD.

investing,AMZN Earnings Report Q2 2023,"\*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*

1. Operating Activities:  
The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  
  
2. Investing Activities:  
Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  
  
3. Financing Activities:  
The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  
  
4. Cash Position:  
Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  
  
5. Debt and Interest Payments:  
The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.  
  
6. Net Sales:  
Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.  
  
7. Operating Expenses:  
Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.  
  
8. Operating Income:  
Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.  
  
9. Non-Operating Expense:  
The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.  
  
10. Net Income (Loss):  
Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.  
  
11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):  
Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.  
  
12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):  
Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.  
  
13. Comprehensive Income (Loss):  
Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.  
  
14. Segment Information:  
Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.  
  
‚Ä¢	North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.  
‚Ä¢	International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.  
‚Ä¢	AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.  
  
Conclusion:  
Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.  
  
Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.

investing,"Do you contribute to a Roth 401k or traditional 401k, or both? Why?","The choice between a Roth 401k and a Traditional 401k seems to lack a clear consensus.

He just told me that the family office that was interested in investing in that company is still looking at investing even though he told them the SEC and IRS are looking into them...

How can this be ok? Doesnt the family office have any sort of duty to their funds to not invest in things that are currently being investigated?

investing,Why are many (especially young people) investing in dividends?,"I think dividend stocks are fundamentally misunderstood by the majority of investors. I (hopefully) imagine most people in r/investing already know dividend mechanics, but I often see a few common arguments on personal finance forums for dividend stocks.  


**(1)** Dividend stocks pay greater yields compared to T-Bills/bonds/GICs, which had low returns throughout the 2010s during the period of ZIRP and post-2020.  


**(2)** The income stream of dividend stocks is more ‚Äúreliable‚Äù than depending on stock prices. Capital gains and losses fluctuate yearly, but dividend payouts are less variable.  


**(3)** The underlying stocks that pay dividends are thought to be more stable; most investors would consider that companies with excess cash to return in dividends, rather than invest in themselves, are in a safer financial position than growth.  


**(4)** Dividend companies are often (*and wrongly*) associated with ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. Dividend stocks can and often do have low P/B, P/E, and often trade near book value, but this is not to say that all dividend stocks are priced in terms of value ([for example, PepsiCo at 33 P/E is equal to Apple](https://ycharts.com/companies/PEP/pe_ratio)).  


**(5)** An idea that dividends are ‚Äúfree money‚Äù, because you aren‚Äôt working for them. This is a very dangerous and flawed way of thinking for investments. For one, *dividends decrease retained earnings*. Two, you can still incur real losses when the underlying stock decreases more than your dividend payout. The fundamental risk-reward tradeoff exists for all investments, including dividend stocks.  


The mechanism of dividends is - at a simple level - fundamentally indifferent to selling stock; stock prices decrease exactly by the dividend payout on the ex-dividend date. [Buffett even argues](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf) that **forced dividend payouts are inferior** to letting shareholders decide their own cash-out policies from capital gain, rather than incurring immediate taxes from dividend income and purchasing stock above book value (which is why Berkshire doesn‚Äôt pay out dividends).  


Mental accounting is our tendency to sort our money into individual categories, rather than treat them homogeneously. Academics suggest that investors have a flawed mindset, so called the ‚Äú*free dividend fallacy*‚Äù by Hartzmark and Solomon; investors and even mutual funds/institutions subconsciously see dividends and price decreases as fundamentally separate, despite their working knowledge. Individuals tend to treat the gains from dividends as separate from the concept of the share price, and analysts are overambitious when forecasting dividend-paying stocks (due to their negligence the fundamental link between dividends and the underlying stock).   


**Dividend demand increases during periods of low interest yields** \- which argues that investors *do* substitute the former for fixed income, despite the fact that they are **completely different asset classes**.  


*They argue that ‚Äú... dividend irrelevance runs counter to intuitions from other areas of life, whereby harvesting the fruit from a tree is viewed as fundamentally different to harvesting the tree itself.*  


*‚Äù*Here is a quick exercise; remember that there are really no similarities between dividends and bonds. You cannot view the idea of cashflow of $10 from a $100 bond as equivalent to $10 from a $100 stock (which will always drop to $90). **There is no promise of dividend yield nor price security from dividends compared to bonds.** There goes the argument of dividends as a ""safe"" blend of equity and fixed income for retirement.  


I'm not sure why many people think that **dividends are earnings.**  


When a company sells down some assets, they often pay out the value as dividends, so taking only dividends is still depleting your asset base (book value of the stock decreases). Really, where the company obtains the dividend cash isn‚Äôt even relevant, whether from profit or assets - it was already part of the company‚Äôs assets.  


Companies pay out part of their income as share buybacks, so your dividends are again not representative of company earnings.  


Most importantly, **companies can pay out any amount of their earnings as dividends** (of course, even cutting them unexpectedly). The more they pay out, your retained earnings and business reinvestment, so your **expected earnings growth will be reduced by the dividend payout**. You‚Äôre not getting more of a return with a company that pays out a higher percentage of their earnings as dividends.**Dividends are not earnings.** And by not reinvesting your dividends (which is still taxed), you‚Äôre **directly drawing down** from your assets, and the **higher your dividend, the more you‚Äôre drawing down**.  


Modigliani-Miller‚Äôs dividend irrelevance theory isn‚Äôt completely applicable in real-life due to taxes (*it actually argues against dividends*), but even more so due to investor psychology. Really, this means that chasing high yields is simply increasing your inefficiency by having more of your income exposed to dividend taxation while the share price still decreases proportionally. Fundamentally, you‚Äôre still speculating on the company that pays dividends through future earnings.

A few arguments *for* dividends say that dividends are useful for companies with excess profit. Rather than potentially squandering it in unfruitful M&A/investments by bad management, they would rather return the cash to shareholders (who should, in theory, be able to get greater returns through investing elsewhere). **This is without argument, a fact.**

But dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) into the same stock *doesn‚Äôt really compute*; you are both incurring more tax inefficiency by immediately realizing your gain (in the case you‚Äôre in a high-income bracket or simply don‚Äôt need the cash that year).

Saying that DRIP gives you the power of compound interest doesn‚Äôt even make sense either; DRIP or a company not paying out a dividend has the same outcome, and any asset with growth experiences compounding. It used to be hailed as a useful method of reinvestment because of commission-free purchases and at times - even discounts of around 2-3% on stock - but this is no longer relevant with modern brokerages and low trading costs. *The caveat is that it is still useful in registered accounts* (where it would be more inefficient to transfer money out rather than directly reinvest to your position).

Another stance is that dividend cashflow maintains a fixed percentage of shareholder ownership compared to selling off stock to substitute dividends; therefore reducing your ownership as a % over time. This holds no water either.Suppose you have two stocks under the condition of perpetual growth of 10%, one that pays its excess earnings in the form of dividends and the other that chooses to retain them (at the same growth rate of the company). Both are initially priced at $100. An investor who owns 1 share must sell 0.1 shares to match the first dividend payout of $10. To match the second dividend, he sells 0.091 shares (because his share price is now $110), to match the third, .083. After 50 dividends, they have 0.01031 shares left, but the share price is $9,700/share.

**Dividend Outperformance**  


Before you state that high-dividend yield stocks have [better returns than the S&P 500 in the long run](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf) \- which they have and may or may not do so in the future- consider that many of these companies are typically smaller in size (less than $5B) and in low-growth sectors (consumer staples/utilities/REITs). Why does this matter? Well, because of [as part of Fama/French‚Äôs 5 factor model](https://www.tacitacapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/High-Dividend-Strategy-under-the-Microscope.pdf). Historically, investing in value in-turn beat high-yield dividend strategies across global markets with higher risk adjusted returns. If that‚Äôs the case, then why not simply skip to the next best thing: value?  


**Gains are not Losses**  
Suppose that you argue that dividends are the key to keeping your investing habit stable; you enjoy seeing the consistent dividend cashflow come out of your account, leading you to continue your habit/motivation. Perhaps you are a follower prospect theory - which states that investors value gains and losses differently, with losses being more emotionally impactful. You prefer the (fairly) certain dividend, versus tracking the ups and downs of stock appreciation. Proponents of DRIP are reasonably happy in the long-term; they never perceive that dividend as entering their  ‚Äúaccount‚Äù or ‚Äúleaving‚Äù when it becomes reinvested. They see greater numbers of shares owned, less perceived losses (DCA in down periods, which reduces your average cost and subsequently your captain gain/loss).  


But what about those that don‚Äôt? Greed is a natural human instinct; there is no denying it. The implications for investing are huge; investors want to spend more now rather than save for the future. They pick and over allocate capital to income-producing assets due to a ""spend it today"" mindset, which is especially relevant if you perceive dividends as ‚Äúexcess‚Äù cash or spend it frivolously. In the long-term horizon, it‚Äôs likely you will miss out on substantial long-term wealth growth.  


This post is not to say that investing in dividend stocks is never a correct choice - far from so. I just wanted to address the misconceptions surrounding dividends that are spouted so often and how they're somehow a superior option.

The bottom line is your investing mindset - especially for young individuals or those with a long timeframe - should be to maximize your total returns, which is likely not in dividend-focused investments (and especially not in relation to yield chasing). If dividends are the factor that motivates you into saving more instead of traditional investing, then so be it; allocate a small portion to that.","['in short it is because the stock market and stock valuations is complex and confusing, but the idea of owning something that pays dividends is very simple and easy to understand.', 'I hope you get paid by the word', 'You can simplify this to one key point, which they helpfully highlight by calling it ""passive income"", they don\'t see owning stock as owning the company, they see it as an immediate short term boost to their bank account.\n\nThe idea that the retained earnings are still there is (to them) immaterial, its fugazi, trusting your stock picks is gambling meanwhile getting some cash right now is material, safe, consistent.', 'K.', 'I‚Äôm retired so not sure about the younger investors but During the recent pullback when the SP500 was down over 20 percent my dividend ETFs held up better than any of my other funds.', '16 YO here.

investing,Adyen - One of the biggest Stripe & Paypal competitor in Europe is down 30% today,"Stock is down 30% and I am a bit shocked and at the same time thinking on buying it

\*\***Background:**\*\*Adyen is a company that provides payment processing and acquiring services to merchants. They work with third parties like financial institutions and network scheme providers to enable these services.The fees charged to Adyen by these third parties are known as ""pass-through settlement fees"", which include interchange and payment network fees.

|Financial Metric|H1 2022|H1 2023|YoY Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Revenue**|‚Ç¨3,947M|‚Ç¨854M|**-78%**|
|**Net Revenue**|‚Ç¨609M|‚Ç¨739M|**+21%**|
|Operating Income|‚Ç¨331M|‚Ç¨279M|\-16%|
|**Net Income**|‚Ç¨282M|‚Ç¨282M|**Flat**|
|Diluted EPS|‚Ç¨9.09|‚Ç¨9.07|\-0.2%|
|EBITDA|‚Ç¨356M|‚Ç¨320M|\-10%|
|EBITDA Margin|59%|43%|\-16pp|
|Free Cash Flow|‚Ç¨309M|‚Ç¨248M|\-20%|
|Cash Balance|‚Ç¨5,584M|‚Ç¨6,412M|\+15%|

The significant decline in revenue was due to the change in revenue recognition methodology for settlement fees in 2023. Net revenue, which excludes settlement fees, increased 21%.

\*\***Previous Policy**:\*\*Up to December 31, 2022, Adyen considered itself primarily responsible for providing payment transaction services. This means they had control over the full settlement service before it was transferred to merchants. In accounting terms, Adyen acted as the ""Principal"" for these fees. When acting as a Principal:Adyen would recognize both the revenue from the fees charged to merchants and the costs from the third parties on a gross basis. This means both the revenue and the costs were shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Change in Policy**:\*\*In H1 2023, Adyen made changes to its terms and conditions related to merchant agreements. These changes clarified the roles and responsibilities of the services provided by third parties. The key points from this change are:Adyen does not provide a significant service of integrating the services from third parties into one combined output for the merchant.Adyen does not control the inputs from third parties before services are provided to the merchant.Because of these changes, Adyen now acts as an ""Agent"" for the pass-through settlement fees, effective from January 1, 2023.

\*\***Impact of Acting as an Agent**:\*\*When acting as an Agent:Adyen only recognizes the net amount (i.e., the difference between what they charge the merchant and what they pay to third parties) in the revenue. This means the gross revenue and the costs from third parties are no longer shown in full in the financial statements.

\*\***Financial Impact**:\*\*Looking at the financial data provided:In H1 2022 (before the change), Settlement fees were ‚Ç¨3,641,350 and Costs incurred from financial institutions were ‚Ç¨3,313,269.In H1 2023 (after the change), Settlement fees dropped significantly to ‚Ç¨485,582, and Costs incurred from financial institutions were only ‚Ç¨74,409.This drastic reduction is because, in 2023, Adyen is only recognizing the net amount in the revenue, whereas in 2022, they were recognizing the full gross amount.

This is how the Revenue growth in the last 9 Yrs looks like:[https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg](https://snipboard.io/1vM0jO.jpg)

investing,What's the best investment tool in a country with hyperinflation and manipulated inflation figures?,"The situation is as follows: 

The government's inflation figures are far below reality. In a situation where real inflation is 122% annually, the announced inflation is only around 40%. The policy rate is even worse, around 17.5%. In such a situation, people do not know how to protect their money against inflation. 

In this situation, the exchange rate is also constantly increasing, but not as much as inflation. The stock market, on the other hand, is always increasing in the long run, but most companies do not increase as much as inflation and at the same time their value in dollar mostly decreasing. Government bonds and interest rates offer returns far below real inflation, so investing money there is a futile endeavor.

investing,Would it be so bad if bond yields stayed this high forever?,"Like many of you my stock portfolio was hurt by the 2022-2023 interest rate increases. Treasury bonds are now attractive so lately I've been buying bonds while I wait for the return to normal.

I really like that I can plan my life around bond yields. Investing in stocks on the other hand feels like nothing more than gambling. Even investing in index funds, we just *hope* they continue to go up, but there's no guarantee that they will. Isn't it crazy that we all have to keep funding the top 500 companies just to be able to retire someday? I don't even know what half those companies do, and the last thing I feel like is reading all their financial statements. But our whole tax and financial system basically forces us to blindly keep funding these companies. I work hard and add value to society through my job, and the last thing I feel like doing when I get home is figuring out how to preserve everything I've worked for. It shouldn't be so difficult.

In theory, if bond yields stayed forever at 5.5% short-term and 4.5% long-term, and inflation dropped back to 2%, then saving for retirement would be so much less stressful. Is this what it was like for boomers? Is it even possible for the economy to reach equilibrium with numbers like that? ","['>In theory, if bond yields stayed forever at 5.5% short-term and 4.5% long-term\n\nThis is an inverted yield curve , the only reason long term rates are lower is because the market is expecting rates to drop in the near future. If the Federal reserve somehow said ""We are going to keep short term interest rates 5% forever"" then long term rates would rise above 5% . \n\nI mean if you knew short term rates were going to stick at 5% forever , why would anyone agree to lend at less then 5% on longer term loans?\n\nHowever what you might be getting at is something  called the ""natural interest rate"" and this is the ""equilibrium"" rate that neither stimulates the economy or cools the economy\n\nHowever even this natural rate will change its not static and will change depending on lots of economic conditions. So here would be the issue if we kept the short term rate static at 5% or 3% or any static number.\n\nIf the natural rate of interest is below this the economy will basically shrink or contract and this is not good because people lose jobs, become unemployed . Getting 5% on savings isn\'t helpful when you have no money to save.\n\nIf the natural rate goes above this static rate , well the economy would get too hot and inflation would jump. Earning 5% interest is not great when inflation is 7%.\n\nBasically because the economy goes through cycles and sometimes it expands fast sometime it expands slow, sometimes it contracts, these rates change so it wouldn\'t be a good idea to say the short term interest rate is always 5% or 4% or 3% and never changes because the economy is always changing.', ""> if bonds stayed up and inflation back down to 2% \n\nThat's not how that works though."", 'OP seems to not understand monetary policy.

investing,"If you can deduct losses from taxes, does that mean your risk tolerance increases as you pay more taxes?","Of course you don't want to go into investing with the intention of losing as money not earned is equivalent to money lost. Individuals who may need liquidity in the short term (entrepreneurs or business owners) can be forced to ""accept"" lower returns in the form of a bond ladder with short maturity rates.

However if your income is large (and thus you pay lots of income tax, say 20k last year) in theory you could move 20k you'd otherwise have in a bond ladder to an ETF. If you happen to need liquidity when the market has taken a downturn, just sell enough of your holdings at a 20k loss and deduct from taxes. It's not ideal, but you retain the upside of potential liquidation at market upturns without having to take a loss at a downturn.

First is that it sounds like your mother is alone.  It is a lot easier to manage investments when you have someone to talk to about the details.  The other issue is that one of the early signs of cognitive decline is screwed up finances.  And cognitive decline is a real thing, most of us will experience it to some degree and it needs to be part of one\'s retirement planning.\n\nFor both of these reasons my wife and I have plans to get a financial advisor at some point in the future and have explored our options in that regard.\n\nAnd a cautionary comment.

For reference, I\'m 38 years old, currently manage the investments left to me by my late mother. I was involved in the investment side of her account for 10 years. We always had an advisor.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Wealth preservation\n\n>It seems like they always get their hooks into the older wealthier people. Is it an **aversion to loss** that explains this?\n\n**YES**\n\nPassive investing is great for **building** wealth. Living off one\'s portfolio requires a degree of active management. An advisor will still use many index funds. A good one will set up hedges for adverse economic conditions.\n\nOld people lose their shit over inflation because it destroys fixed income. The recent rapid rate hikes have destroyed bonds. Old people actively need their bonds managed for them (called ""laddering"") to protect principle from interest rate changes. Having their entire allocation in BND means when rate hikes hit, their whole bond allocation is going to suffer. Depending on the account size, an advisor will either buy individual bonds for them or select actively managed bond funds for them. Why actively managed funds? Because bonds are a lot more predictable than stocks. They actually can be actively managed well.\n\nThere are other hedges too, but actively managing bonds is the biggest one for the elderly.\n\n2.  Legal requirements\n\nSometimes you\'re legally required to have a fiduciary. This is likely because you have an irrevocable trust. This was the case for my mother. We were required to have an independent trustee, and I\'m glad we did. My mother was disable and could not manage any of her own finances. For AUM, we got a trust officer that took care of this for us in addition to an FA that handled the investments. This allowed me and my siblings to have lives of our own.\n\n3. Preservation of relationships\n\nPeople have mentioned this. Fastest way to ruin a relationship is by mismanaging money. This applies not just to parent-child relationships, but even couples. My dad and step-mom aren\'t disabled, but don\'t have the same approach to finances and investments. My step-mom could 100% manage her own investments as she used to work in finance herself. My dad doesn\'t have that kind of expertise and he\'s the type that likes to do what he wants without listening to others. She\'d have a plan and he\'d just do random stuff. They\'d be divorced if they didn\'t have an FA and my dad would likely be broke.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The fee\n\nIf you\'re relatively young, single with no kids, not high net worth and at least halfway know what you\'re doing, an advisor is overkill. This is why I don\'t have one.\n\n2. Bad advisors\n\nOur mother\'s first fiduciary wasn\'t great. Although my mother needed to stay conservatively invested, these people took that to an extreme. I wasn\'t involved from the start with her investments because I was too young, but when I first saw them, I phoned my brother in panic immediately because of how bad it was (things like 2% 5-year CDs and zero exposure to equities; she did not have enough that she would be okay with a 2% return, before fees, on her money). They also refused to budge on their philosophy. Their idea of ""growth"" was going in on gold at it\'s peak in 2011. They lost my mom a lot of money on that and that\'s when we finally fired them.\n\nSo for an elderly parent that uses an advisor, just make sure they have a decent one. But you\'ll need to see their portfolio to know if that\'s the case. If you can demonstrate with your own money that you have at least a half-decent understanding of investing, they might feel it\'s okay to show you what they\'re holding. If you have any concerns, you should tell them and you can even offer to sit in on their meetings with their advisor. But still have an advisor.', 'The pros help you and the cons steal from you.', '**Pros of a Financial Advisor:**\nExpertise, personalized advice, diversified portfolio, time savings, behavioral coaching, holistic financial planning.\n\n**Cons of a Financial Advisor:**\nCosts, conflicts of interest, varying advisor quality, potential loss of control, market risk, overdependence.', 'For the amount of fee it is worth the effort to avoid worrying about outcomes.

investing,"If you had 60k to invest in either Apple or Google, which would you choose?","As the title states, I have 60k I‚Äôd like to invest in a strong tech company as part of my retirement portfolio. Both companies are very attractive. Obviously Apple pays a dividend so I could drip over the next 19 years. But google has their hands in so many potential markets (AI, autonomous vehicles, medical‚Ä¶) that the potential for growth is very attractive. I‚Äôm forty-six and plan to retire at 65 (to gain full pension and medical). I‚Äôm not a savvy investor and want to do the right thing to provide added security for me and my wife. Are there better options that I should consider? We have a vanguard Roth, 401k, that we only established a few years ago. We max out our investment every year. Thanks for the advice and please let me know if I‚Äôm looking at this completely wrong. Again, I am not a savvy investor!","[""Look at the top 10 companies by market cap each year in the 1990s and early 200s, then compare it to the top 10 today. Notice how most of the companies in the top 10 back then aren't in the top 10 today?\n\nYou'd be better off buying a low cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. Apple and Google make up a large portion of that index, so you get to feel good about it. But you substantially lower your risk by doing this instead of buying a single stock."", 'I replied to a comment already. But I have a quick additional point about picking the ""biggest"" and best companies in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe know empirically, that after a company joins the top 10 companies in size (measured by market cap), they tend to perform poorly from a returns perspective.Examining total market domestic data from 1927-2019, companies that break the top 10 by market cap, on average:\n\nReturn an average annualized premium of .7% over the broad market 3 years after\n\nBut 5 years after, that average annualized premium is **\\*\\*-1.1%\\*\\***\n\nAnd 10 years after, **\\*\\*-1.5%\\*\\*** annually.\n\nEmpirically, we have the data (and theory) to understand why this underperformance happens.On its way to breaking into the top 10, investors assign a lower discount rate to these mega cap stocks.\n\nWe know that a lower discount rate implies a lower expected rate of return.This happens because investors build in the expectation that the company will continue to grow its revenues, cash flows and margins.\n\nAs a result, the price of the security tends to rise far quicker than fundamentals support.The hot hand fallacy. Recency bias that these big winners will always continue to be big winners.\n\nThe majority of the time, actualized performance does NOT match the expectations.For example, let‚Äôs use Apple.\n\n**Currently, AAPL currently trades at roughly 7.5 times revenue.In the past 10 years it only managed to grow its revenue 2.2x (which is still astoundingly impressive, but far from the current expectation of 7x)**\n\n**\\*\\*Let that sink in for a second.\\*\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile that is sinking in let me quickly discuss the concept of expected returns.We know from financial economics that a stock\'s value is the discounted price that the market is willing to pay for the company\'s expected future profits.The expected stock return is the discount rate applied to those expected future profits.If you expect Apple to deliver some level of profits and you buy those expected profits at a 10% discount, you expect to earn a 10% return on your investment.In order for Apple (and other Megacaps) to continue delivering unexpectedly good stock returns, they will need to deliver financial results that exceed the current high expectations that the market has set for them.\n\nSo, we know that those ‚Äúhigh market expectations‚Äù are 7.5x revenue growth, despite the fact that Apple only grew its revenue 2.2x in the last decade.\n\nYes, I am repeating myself for emphasis.And remember, the past 10 years were also aided by RECORD levels of QE and low rates.This means that in a TOUGHER macro environment, Apple could grow its revenue 2x faster than the last decade (4.4x revenue growth) and still underperform the priced expectation of 7.5x.\n\nThis is why it‚Äôs going to be so difficult for Apple to match those expectations.Just like Apple, why did the IBMs / CSCOs / PALMs / GEs / AT&Ts / GMs of the world all underperform after being the hottest stock on Wall Street?\n\n**Because investors placed unrealistic expectations on these companies.Investors poured in capital, driven by hype speculation and momentum. Prices exceed fundamentals and increased expectations.**\n\n3, 5, 10, 15 years out, actualized performance failed to match expectations and valuations failed to match the broad market.That‚Äôs where the underperformance comes from.\n\nSources & additional reading\n\n:[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=1757025](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1757025)[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04398.x](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04398.x)', 'With that much money to invest if I was certain I wanted a tech focus I would choose QQQ over any individual stock', '$VOO', 'I wouldn‚Äôt put all my eggs in one basket.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt already invest in a total market index fund or NASDAQ index fund, I would do that instead.

investing,Master thesis on cognitive biases among investors and their impact on stock market efficiency,"Hello r/Investing!  
In this upcoming fall semester, I am writing my Master Thesis on a topic within Behavioral Finance. More specifically, I want to write about cognitive biases among investors and how such biases can affect stock market efficiency. I know this topic is not very concrete and my research question will need to be a lot more precise.  
I have been looking at certain journals of behavioral finance, etc, but a lot of the studies have access to advanced data which I wont have access to.  
Do any of you have a good idea for a topic or know of any interesting, publicly available data, which can be used for my thesis?  
Any input is highly appreciated!","['Do a study of WallStreetBets. There are one or two cognitive biases there.', ""Carl Richards and Daniel Kahneman are two people in the space I'd encourage you to read up on. They have plenty of literature on the topic.

Fo not use Google.', 'It\'s not specific to behavior finance (though, it is by someone who won a Nobel Prize for behavioral economics), but I\'ve recently been reading ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman and it covers a number of topics that seem like they could be relevant. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) seems to have a good overview of the topics in the book. The book also has an extensive bibliography, which you could hopefully use to find more relevant academic sources.', 'What about as a topic, ""the effect of emotions that influence cognitive biases among investors and the impacts to the stock market""?\n\nEmotions drive thought that generate ideas/beliefs that people can hooked on and view these ideas/beliefs as reality. An individual who lacks emotional awareness will not see the effect of their emotional state, and how it is impacting their thought process of decision making.', ""You could create some polls that measure cognitive biases (look at how academic papers frame the questions) and circulate them on various reddit boards or other online fora (e.g. Bogleheads and Rational Reminder communities which may be more sophisticated than the average investor). I'd be interested to see how behaviorally different the people on r/bogleheads are from those at, say, r/personalfinance, r/investing or r/wallstreetbets. Not sure how reliable any of these self-reported data would be though, but could be a fun extra section in your paper."", ""Get the latest copy of the book Irrational Exuberance and look at the appendix.

I think a lot of research on behavioral bias use lab studies (games) or surveys to gather data. \n\nI would think it's easy to find evidence of bias affecting decisions but it may be quite hard to show how it affects market efficiency. I admit I'm not very familiar with academic research on market efficiency but most of what I've seen just seem to assume it or believe in it like religious faith. I'm not sure how you measure it or identify the causal sources of inefficiency."", 'People are stupid. The people who are smart overestimate their intelligence which leads them to do stupid things.

investing,Why would I not buy bonds right now?,"I'm a 26yr M with a pretty good grip on stock investment knowledge. What makes a good investment etc etc. 
But recently with Treasury Bond yields at highs I've delved into some new research on them

I've always understood they're a long-term safe investment with a low-moderate yield. But now I'm seeing that you can buy bonds, get the yearly yield while you have it, and ALSO trade them in the process. The price of Bonds tends to increase as Fed interest rates lower, and decrease as Fed interest rates increase.

My question is: with bond yields so high right now, and the price of bonds going up when Fed interest rates go down, and a volatile uncertain market, it sounds like a REALLY great idea to put a ton of money in some bonds, get 5+% interest on them in the meantime, then when rates go down you can sell them at a profit.
I'm looking at 1month-1year Bonds. The 3-6 month Bonds seem like such a great small time window.

Is there any reason to not do this??

I haven't been able to see/find a chart of the price of bonds on the open market, only yield rates, so I don't actually know how much you can profit on a bond when Fed interest rates go down. A Futures chart isn't the open market price right? 
But overall I can't really see why I wouldn't do this unless I wanted way higher gains in the equities market. Which could also definitely happen when Fed rates lower. 

But it sounds like a great investment right now.

investing,Keeping cash in a money market fund vs. HYSA,"I have been exploring the best way to allocate my funds, and have been wondering what is the best way to hold onto cash itself. I have been using a HYSA for this to keep a few thousand dollars, but am curious what benefit a mutual fund like SWVXX would offer over a HYSA.

Is there a benefit to keeping money in this form over a HYSA? Are returns better long-term? 7-day yield is 5.09% with a 0.340% expense ratio, which is comparable to interest rates for HYSAs right now in the high 4 to low 5 percent range.

this is not my situation. this is not anybody's situation for that matter. we were discussing an hypothetical scenario among us. we were pondering over what happens if one were able to borrow at such low rates before fed rate hikes and might be sitting on that cash. what would they do. 

  
it's kind of interesting that the investing community isn't liking this. and i can't figure out why :)","['If the loan must be paid in equal installments (like a car loan or mortgage) and only from the balance of the investment, I wouldn\'t do this.  Maybe with a much longer term, but not at only 5 years.  I think that\'s why you\'re getting so much pushback.  Here\'s my reasoning:\n\nTotal market investing is much too volatile for this.  I might average 9-10% annual returns, but I could easily lose 20-30% in any year and really derail things.  I could invest in bonds like treasuries, which are currently yielding around 5.5% in the short term.  After taxes that\'s like 4.2%.  Sounds ok, but those could go down as low as 0% if we have another recession.  So I\'ll look at 2-3 year treasuries, which are closer to 4.7% yield right now, or 3.57% after taxes.  That\'s a spread of 0.4%.  Over 5 years with an average balance of $50k, that\'s worth $1k, so not really worth my time.  Maybe I could roll the dice with shorter term bills and hope the rate stays high, and just pay it off in full if rates drop?  Yeah it might be ""free money"" but it just seems like a lot of gymnastics for a smallish return.\n\nThere are a couple scenarios where I might do this though:\n1. If I could pay $1/month for 59 months, then I\'d buy 5-year treasuries with the rest and pay off the balance when it matures.\n2. If I could pay this monthly with my normal income stream, then I\'d take the bait and throw this into my investment accounts.  Maybe I\'m a little behind after 5 years but probably not, but even then I have decades to ride it out.\n\nEven scenario 2 is a bit risky if I lose my job and default and screw up my credit rating, so maybe I\'d skip all this and just invest my salary in the market as I earn it.\n\nI think for most people, the name of the game is just living within your means and saving enough to have a comfortable lifestyle and not stress about money, not over-leveraging yourself to maximize every penny of wealth.', ""How much risk you can take?

You keep the extra $6K in a simple savings account to make 3 months of loan payments. At the end of the term you should have paid some principal + $812 in interest vs collecting $1243 on the T-bills. You then rinse and repeat assuming the T-Bills still have a high enough interest rate. Otherwise you payout the loan early.\n\nThe above will never work in reality though because personal loan rates are always higher then T-Bill rates. The only thing that can work is in lower interest rate environments you can take out a home equity line of credit for a few percent and invest it in safer dividend growth stocks that pay 3-6% such as banks, utilities and telecom companies. The dividend the stocks pay is more then the interest on the HELOC. Plus the stocks and dividend tend to go up over time. Even in a market crash you should still get enough in dividends to pay the interest while you wait for the stocks to bounce back in value. It also seems that you have to use a HELOC as personal loan rates never quite get low enough to make this worth while.\n\nInstead of a HELOC you can use a margin account but in a 2008 style market crash you'll get wiped out with margin calls as stock prices crash.

Which opens you up to a world of hurt if there‚Äôs a market downturn.\n\nThe way I would treat it, is by determining a leverage ratio based on your current cash. E.g. If you have $30k in cash and put all of your money in stocks, you‚Äôd be leveraged around $130/$30k = 4.3x.\n\nI would limit any ‚Äúleverage‚Äù to around 1.5x in stocks, which would be investing $15k of your borrowed money, and $30k of your regular money into stocks.

investing,The reason why the stock market ALWAYS is over valued.,"I know that to figure out whether the broad market is over valued is GDP to the diff indexs. Wilshire 5000, Sp500 etc.  When you do that, the market ALWAYS seems too high.  I'm guessing its because people today don't know what the hell to do w their EXTRA $$$.  They can buy a second house, they can buy bonds but really, other than the stock market, that's about it.

  Once Mutual funds came out IN THE 80'S  (which of course IS the stock market.) boomers and gen xers have been chucking their $$$ into that.  Teens today speculate on their phones with Robinhood with little fear of losing $$$  Nobody really seems afraid to invest in the market.

My grandpa (92) and his friends are/were TERRIFIED of the stock market. Nobody older than the baby boomers would put their $$$ anywhere near that thing. They were even a bit afraid of banks.   They would buy real estate or even freezers full of fish and drums of heating oil, cans of food but never stocks.  I'm guessing this is why the stock market valuations blew up more than anything else in the last 40 years. People now have less fear of the markets and they need SOMEWHERE to invest.

investing,Sankyo Corp establishing a Monopoly in japan,"I was researching companies with a moat and stabil integradet marketposition when I found Sankyo Corp. a japanese buisness fabricating and selling the japanese cult game Panchinko.

Sankyo has cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 Billion Dollars and almost no debt which results in 32,7$ Cash per share.

I calculated an approximately Asset Value of 2,098 Billion Dollar which results in 36,13$ per share.

The company has a high profitmargin of 30% which speaks for its strong marketposition.
I only know about one competing company which is Fujishoji Ltd a way smaller buisness in the same segment but with smaller profitmargin and decreasing revenue while the revenue of Sankyo is increasing strongly.

They both only earn money in Japan selling panchikos but it looks like sankyo establishing a Monopoly by gaining more and more marketshare.

Also the Cashflow is increasing very strongly. I calculated an average FCF-growth rate of 35,5% over the last 7 years and used a Discountrate of 15% which seems very conservative and calculated an intrinsic value of approximately 120$ per share. The current price is 45$ so we are applying a Margin of Safety of 65%.

In conclusion for me it seems like Sankyo is very strong buisness with an almost perfect balancesheet. It is increasing its revenue and free Cashflow constantly and has a high profitmargin and ROIC it is also paying a reliable dividend of 2.7%.
I know that in times of digitalisation the use of non-digital games will decrease but panchiko is a cult game which can be found in almost every japanese street. Because of the fact that this segment is decreasing I think that the probability of new entrants is very small which makes it easier to establish a Monopoly for Sankyo. 

Please let me know your thoughts about Sankyo. In my opinion it could be a perfect value company with a flourishing future in a shrinking industry.üòâ","['Add to this, Japan legalized actual gambling like Vegas or Macau recently.

investing,"My strategy has been ""wrong"" for the last decade (Intl vs US). Will I continue to be wrong in the next decade?","I made a decision 10+ years ago to invest heavily in international. IXUS is my largest holding. My logic at the time was that since I live and work in the U.S., international investing would be a bit of a hedge. International was also much cheaper on about every metric CAPE, PE, P/B etc. as it remains today.

Of course I've only gotten punished for my decision since then with the U.S. continuing to outperform. But when I bat around the idea of making changes now I find it hard to swallow that the U.S. will continue to outperform again for another 10 years. Am I crazy to stick with a portfolio heavily weighted towards intl?

I've got Fidelity ETFs but I'm sure the numbers are close for Vanguard:

IXUS: P/E of 13, yield of 2.3%, P/B of 1.7

ITOT: P/E of 21, yield of 1.4%, P/B of 3.7

Like what is more likely, the rest of the world seeing 50% multiple expansion to get to a P/E of 19.5 or the U.S. seeing the same to get to a PE of 31.5 or choose your own favorite scenario/metric. Maybe the numbers would get a little closer if you were to strip out the high flyers like AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, etc. I have been building out a position in SCHD to help get a little more balance but am I nuts to stay the course?

Nvidia today delivered GAAP 46% net income on $13.5B and guided significantly above best street whisper estimates ($14B) to $16B/qtr.  Their FPE moved significantly down from 58 -- there is an argument at $500/sh next 12mos FPE could be under 30 (EPS of $18/sh), but we can wait for the analysts numbers for a more accurate calculation.  Either way, explosive growth like this seems unprecedented in modern times.

I described the company's management, execution, about their strategy, and argued in the above link and how Nvidia has little in the way of competition.    They seemingly own Infrastructure for the next generation of computing, AI, and they are delivering on the promise.  70%GMs, a clear runway littered with fat margin dollars waiting to be scooped up, and no one giving any kind of meaningful challenge.

So with growth like that is Nvidia overvalued?

investing,"If this is a bad economy, please tell me what a good economy would look like","We should acknowledge that things are going well, even as we continue to look for problems to solve.

By Noah Smith

I do not want to be a shill for the Biden administration. Yes, I like most of what Biden is doing on industrial policy. But I really want to resist being one of those center-left pundits who always just blasts out the latest press release of a Democratic administration and trumpets how many jobs the President has ‚Äúcreated‚Äù. That sort of partisan cheerleading would be damaging to my credibility (or at least my self-respect) as an independent analyst of the economy, and it would also play into the kind of silly simplifications that the media too often uses to talk about the macroeconomy ‚Äî for example, the idea that the President ‚Äúcreates jobs‚Äù, or is responsible for everything that happens to the economy under his watch.

And yet when I look at how the U.S. economy is doing right now, I find it difficult to describe it in terms that allow me to avoid sounding like a shill. I know lots of Americans still think the economy is doing poorly, and are upset about that. But when I look at objective measures, I just can‚Äôt rationalize that negative viewpoint. Because as far as I can tell from the actual numbers, this economy is doing really, really well.

Why the economy is doing really, really well

What do we want from the macroeconomy?

We want employment to be high, meaning that as many people as possible who want jobs can get them.

We want inflation to be low, so that people have certainty about how far their paycheck and their savings will go in the future.

We want real incomes to rise, meaning that we‚Äôre able to consume more than we could in the past, or save more if we want to.

(There‚Äôs a fourth thing we might want, which is wealth, but that‚Äôs more complicated and I‚Äôll talk about it later.)

Basically, this is the whole list. If people have jobs, inflation is low, and real incomes are rising, the economy is good. That doesn‚Äôt mean people necessarily realize it‚Äôs good ‚Äî social strife, or partisan polarization, or lingering pessimism from past disasters may cause people to be pessimistic about the economy even in the face of great data, a phenomenon some refer to as a ‚Äúvibecession‚Äù. But while I acknowledge that people‚Äôs feelings are important and that there are other things that matter besides the economy, when I‚Äôm analyzing how well the macroeconomy is actually performing, I can‚Äôt go on vibes.

And when we look at the objective numbers, they are great. First of all, there‚Äôs the employment situation. Some indicators of employment, like labor-force participation, look bad because we‚Äôre in the middle of the great Baby Boom retirement. That‚Äôs why you generally shouldn‚Äôt use measures of the labor force that don‚Äôt adjust for age! When we do adjust for age, we find that the U.S. job market is now the best that it‚Äôs been in recorded history. Here‚Äôs the employment rate ‚Äî i.e. the percentage of Americans who have a job ‚Äî adjusted for age:

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab8bdbf8-7696-4c14-b516-f1babc5b19b8_791x533.jpeg

This shows what the employment rate would have been since 1981 if the fractions of the U.S. population in each age group were the same as in February 2020, right before the pandemic. Basically, we have a much older population today than we used to, and this is a way to try to take that into account. Now you can say ‚ÄúWell, if the labor market of 2023 were as good as 1999, then old people would be working a lot more in 2023 than they did back in 1999.‚Äù And maybe that‚Äôs true, but if so, there‚Äôs not really much way to tell. The assumption that aging works about the same in 2023 as it worked in 1999 seems like a good one. And even if the reality is a little bit off from that assumption, we‚Äôre still pretty damn near the best labor market ever.

Next up we have inflation. This has, of course, been the big problem since the start of 2021. But now inflation is plunging; if it‚Äôs not back to its target, it‚Äôs headed there very rapidly. In month-to-month terms, PCE inflation (which the Fed likes better than the more commonly used CPI) is now below the 2% target.

https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb08b3c8c-ac2a-417b-958b-3254f4efec64_1318x450.png

Slower-moving measures are all headed downward. Broader measures are falling rapidly as well. And when you include the rents that people are paying on new leases instead of rents for leases signed long ago, inflation looks even lower. Meanwhile, market inflation expectations, measured by the 5-year breakeven, increasingly look like they‚Äôve been completely tamed, which means people think the Fed has inflation under control in the long term:

Just sell it and get a low version. Use the money instead to invest in IRA', ""It's great that you're thinking about your financial future and considering opening an IRA to start saving for retirement. Here are some steps and considerations to help you get started:\r  \n\r  \nEmergency Fund: Before you start investing, make sure you have an emergency fund in place. This fund should cover at least 3-6 months' worth of living expenses. It's important to have this safety net in case of unexpected expenses or emergencies.\r  \n\r  \nPay Off High-Interest Debt: Prioritize paying off your credit card balance. High-interest debt can eat into your finances and hinder your ability to save and invest effectively.\r  \n\r  \nIRA: Opening an IRA is a good step towards retirement savings. You have two main options: a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you'll pay taxes when you withdraw the funds in retirement. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.\r  \n\r  \nContribution Limits: For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,000 per person ($7,000 if you're 50 or older). While it's ideal to contribute the maximum if you can, even smaller contributions can add up over time.\r  \n\r  \nInvestment Options: Once you have an IRA account, you'll need to choose how to invest the funds within the account. Fidelity offers a range of investment options, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and target-date funds. If you're not confident in making investment choices, you might consider a target-date fund that automatically adjusts its asset allocation based on your expected retirement date.\r  \n\r  \nLong-Term Perspective: Retirement investing is a long-term endeavor. While it's important to monitor your investments periodically, avoid making knee-jerk reactions based on short-term market fluctuations. Over time, the power of compounding can help your investments grow.\r  \n\r  \nProfessional Advice: If you're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about investment choices, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.\r  \n\r  \nAdditional Savings: As you mentioned your goals of slowing down after paying off your house and car and buying a second property, it's important to continue saving beyond your IRA. Consider other investment options such as taxable brokerage accounts or real estate.\r  \n\r  \nEducation: Take the time to educate yourself about personal finance and investing. There are plenty of resources available online, including articles, videos, and online courses, that can help you build your knowledge and confidence.\r  \n\r  \nRemember that every step you take towards saving and investing is a positive one. Even starting with smaller contributions can make a difference over time. It's also important to regularly review and adjust your financial plan as your circumstances change.""]"
investing,New Parents - 529 or Custodial Brokerage?,"Hi all-

New parents here in need of opinions/advice on whether we should be investing into a 529 or a custodial brokerage for our newborn (only child). We expect to be able to deposit about $300/month. We are both already maxing out our Roth IRAs.

I personally don‚Äôt like the inflexibility of the 529, but like the idea of it being tax exempt.

Thank you!","[""Father of a newborn here who has been doing similar research. One thing I didn't see in those threads is financial aid implications.\n\nA custodial brokerage in your child's name and is considered their asset when it comes to FAFSA; so it is given something like a 20% weight when considering need.\n\nA 529 is considered your asset, so it's considered within the normal range with your other assets (IIRC somewhere around 6%).\n\nThe tax breaks of a 529 are a nice bonus, but at least in my state it would come out to a max of about $500 if my wife and I were both putting in 10k a year (no chance), so not exactly amazing.\n\nThe one other consideration that I did see in those threads is it sounds like 529 will allow you to convert about 35k to a Roth, which could set your child up beautifully coming out of the gate in college. I'm hopeful the amount will increase by the time my son is college age.\n\nI won't suggest you should do one or the other, but those were my biggest takeaways in research. I plan to do a 529 and simply buy stocks/funds under my or my wife's own account (with input from my son to teach him a bit about the market) and then slowly gift whatever is not used to cover education expenses when he is ready for major milestones like a house, wedding, big trip, etc.\n\nHope this helps. Congrats and good luck!"", '529 is the way to go long term for the tax benefits and more flexible than it may seem given money can be shifted to other beneficiaries, used for high school and other education and even up to like $35 dumped off to a Roth one day.  \n\nFor me, over 15 years of saving in a 529, the majority of the account is tax free earnings and really helpful in covering core expenses.  \n\nThat said, to get started a brokerage is fine.  Kids can earn some passive income at zero/very low tax rates.  So up to a point you can mange the brokerage to be essentially tax free.  But in the long run a brokerage cashed out for college, etc  could generate a lot a taxable gains at parent tax rates and that will cost you.', ""My brokerage is my kids' college fund. \n\nIf she doesn't need it I'll buy a boat. \n\nIf she needs it, then it's there."", '[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zqnckx/open\\_custodial\\_or\\_individual\\_529\\_account\\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zqnckx/open_custodial_or_individual_529_account_for/)  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/14gefg2/529\\_vs\\_custodial\\_account\\_for\\_new\\_baby/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/14gefg2/529_vs_custodial_account_for_new_baby/)', ""529. 18 years of tax free growth is no joke.

The amount of exponential tax-free growth trumps anything else.

investing,Can someone justify the existence of fund managers to me?,"I spent the day trawling through a random investment management company (Invesco) looking at all their investment packages. 

Now it's all very sophisticated and operating at a level an amateur never could. Each fund containing 100+ companies, many I've never heard of, I'm sure carefully weighted. ESG considerations, region specific things. Funds focusing on Asia small cap, European mid cap, fixed income markets, investment grade corporate bonds.

The thing is almost every single one of them has performed terribly. Almost none have outperformed the S&P or even come close to it. A lot a down from 10 years ago, specifically the Asian ones. A couple of US equities have very very slightly beat the market, but if you take out management fees I'm not even sure if it wins.

I'm just wondering, what do these people think of themselves? I'm sure they have meetings where they assess their performance. Is there an awkward silence in the room when they show that their fund focused on ""long term capital growth"" with a 1% management fee is down 10% in the last 10 years? I'm sure they're all on high 6 figure salaries too. Do they look at their job as worthwhile? All they've done is lose money or underperform the market. You can view the profile of the fund manager, all have great credentials and decades of experience... and all for what? To be paid millions to lose people's money?

I'm not even saying they're bad managers, it seems being a manager of a fund focused on Asia has been doomed to failure. And any play that *could* drastically beat the market they probably aren't even allowed to do anyway. 

They all have huge NAV too so there's clearly lots of demand for these 1000 different packages. I wonder where it all comes from. Who is using these? Who looks at ""Invesco Belt and Road Bond Fund - A(RMB Hgd) MD -1"" and thinks, yes, give me that one.

I'm sure you could say these funds provide benefit by providing capital to many smaller entities but at that point it's just a charity.

I guess i could understand it more if these were all tiny funds that's a very niche corner of the market used by gamblers, but its the complete opposite of that.

investing,Cost of capital. I don't know if I understand right...,"I started today the study of basic finance concepts, and in the concept of PRESENT VALUE, I encounter the cost of capital. From what I comprehend the cost of capital can be intended as the minimun rate of return to cover the risk of the investment. Am I right?","['Aswath Damodaran (his courses can be found on Youtube, he is a professor at NYU) gives a good explainer on how to calculate the cost of capital.  Say you have a business and you want to derive a valuation.  You are correct that it\'s the present value of the future cashflow.  So PV of the business = sum over time of \\[Cash Flow at time t / (1 + r)\\^t\\].  \n\n\nThe cost of capital is the r in that formula.  Now, what is the discount rate?  Simply put, it\'s the  weighted average of the cost of debt and the cost of equity.  Both the amount of debt and the amount of shareholder equity can be found in the balance sheet.  For example, if the business has 9 million in debt at 5% and 1 million in shareholder-equity with a equity cost of capital of 10% it\'s r = .9\\*5% + .1\\*10%.\n\nThe cost of capital on the debt is easy, it\'s just the interest rate on the debt.\n\nOk, so last question, what is the cost of shareholder equity?  This is where it gets annoying.   \n There are many ways to do this, but I\'ll give a simple one.  You need some way of quantifying how risky this business is.  The simplest way of doing this is using the CAPM model, where you define the risk of a business as how sensitive it is to market fluctuations.  This is called the stock\'s beta.  A beta of 2 means that when the stock market is up 1% this stock will go up on average 2%.  And vice versa, if the market goes down 1% then the stock on average decreases 2%.  (Or, you go to yahoo finance and just take the beta they calculate...). Then you need an equity risk premium (which is the return you get for being exposed to the market.  Again, just take the current equity risk premium from Aswath\'s Website.).\n\nThe cost of equity is then the risk free rate plus beta\\_of\\_stock \\* equity risk premium.\n\nThat\'s all you need to know, but I\'ll also mention why more complex and comprehensive extensions exist.\n\nYou can incorporate more factors into your model when deciding a beta discount rate.  Market beta is a well known source of risk.  The more volatile the stock -> the higher the beta -> the more you discount future earnings.  But you could have other measures, which you could include in your formula of cost of equity.  Other people have done this, and they generally fall under ""multi factor models."" (Again, briefly discussed in Aswath Damodaran\'s class).  \n\n\nFinally, you can just plug in your cost of capital.  You can say ""idc what the market should require, I want a 15% return"", then plug that into your Discounted Cash Flow model as the cost of equity.  Whatever share price you get is the price you\'d need to pay in order to get your desired return.  \n\n\nHope this helps!  If you have questions just let me know!', 'Effectively, yes. \n\nSo for very low risk projects or investment opportunities, you would use a low cost of capital and for high risk projects or opportunities you would use a higher rate.', ""The return on an investment asset X over a particular time period is the total value that it generates minus the total cost of owning it. The cost of capital is an ingredient in total cost (along with taxes, expense ratios, maintenance costs, etc.) which represents the _opportunity cost_ of investing in X as opposed to whatever else you would have done with the money instead.\n\nFor example, let's say you're deciding between buying a house and renting. In the case where you rent, you would still have a big chunk of money that would have been your down payment on the house. Probably you would invest that money in something else, and the present value of the future returns on that investment should be considered as a cost of buying the house - it's money that you gave up in order to own the home.\n\nA key point here is that the cost of capital depends on your preferences - e.g. if you are deciding between buying a house or renting + investing in the stock market, and I'm deciding between buying a house or renting + blowing the down payment at Vegas, then my cost of capital is lower than yours."", 'Sorry on mobile - SufferingPHD‚Äôs post', 'Yes, your cost of capital can be seen as your hurdle rate or minimum return vs risk being taken on. \nIRR as someone stated is also used for this measure. Ot shows you the cost of capital i.e. discount rate that would make a series of cash flows have an NPV of zero. Essentially the higher the IRR the better the project because it can withstand higher levels of risk.', '>From what I comprehend the cost of capital can be intended as the minimun rate of return to cover the risk of the investment. Am I right?\n\nEh.....not really, but you\'re on the right track.\n\nWhat you described is probably better understood in the corporate finance world as IRR (or even more ambiguous, ""hurdle rate"").\n\nWACC is literally what the acronym stands for: the weighted average of your cost of equity and cost of debt (and other sources of capital that show up on the balance sheet that are probably too nuanced for this comments).\n\nCost of debt: if you\'re a publicly traded company, (long term) bond yield represents this perfectly.\n\nCost of equity: a bit more nebulous, but the shorthand explanation boils down to ""how volatile is your recurring, periodic cash flow available to providers of equity capital, relative to other available investments"" (although if you\'re a public company that issues a regular dividend, the yield is a good proxy and doesn\'t require you to do any covariance or correlation math to calc it)', 'maybe I understand... the cost of capital is a parameter that I use to ""decrease"" the value of a possible high-risk investment so as to understand how convenient it actually is in the ""worst case"".  did I get it right?\nNow I need to figure out how to evaluate the FV...', 'As a person that actually works in finance, this is the most apt description / example on this thread.', 'The weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \nIt is the sum of weighted components of a company/project financing.

I believe the average PE of the S&P is somewhere around 25 with tech closer to 45, book value is at an ATH; you don‚Äôt need a DCF on the entire US market to see equities are trading at what history would tell us are high multiples.

With that in mind, I can‚Äôt help but think about the amount of new money that‚Äôs been brought in in the last 20 years as ease of access to investing, as well as financial savvy has grown. I mean look at the market cap of the US market here:

https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/

Combine and contrast that to the speed of information from 1980-2000s vs now. Companies can excel or fail at exponentially faster rates as a result of the marketing tools, analysis, and direct-to-consumer technologies available.

Are we just in a new norm as a result of these things? I‚Äôm not saying the market isn‚Äôt overvalued but is it AS overvalued as analysts think or should we be adjusting our baselines?

Thanks in advance for your inputs. Cheers!","['I was starting my career and investing the last time we saw similar valuation levels in 1999-2000 and very similar thoughts were expressed then...""new normal"", ""new technology"", ""valuation doesn\'t matter"". Prior period of similar high valuation was in the late 60\'s - I wasn\'t alive but I would bet people saying the same thing then. Both times there was a subsequent recession and drop in valuation. \n\nThere does seems to be a general upward bias in valuations. Some of it can be explained by increase in net share buybacks relative to dividends since around the 80\'s. I don\'t know if there\'s been a net increase in invested assets (relative to GDP). Certainly more people are investing for themselves now, but historically money was still being invested for individuals by pensions. I think the bigger difference is that the net asset allocation of investments has shifted toward equities and away from bonds as yields have fallen since the early 80s. This increases relative demand for equities, driving up valuation, and driving down equity risk premiums. \n\nI\'m still investing in equities. If you look back in time at US history (and other countries) valuation tends to be very slow moving and can be at very low or very high values for a long time. We talk about ""normal valuation"" but there\'s never been an extended period of time where the market has hovered at the historical average. Far more often it has been below or above the average for long periods of time. \n\nMarket timing based on equity valuation levels just doesn\'t work very well. I just accept that buying at high values probably limits future return expectations and that something eventually will trigger a painful drop in valuation. And that\'s really the only thing that\'s normal about investing - if there is no pain, then there\'s no premium.', 'Everything looks overvalued when they are at or near all time highs. Ignore the noise and keep investing. Don‚Äôt try to time the market or you‚Äôll end up like the trillions on the sidelines the last 10months missing a huge run up.', 'Why does this new norm only target the S&P500? \n\nThere is a ton of stuff whose valuations are at or below historical average: Small Cap, Mid Cap, SCV, Value, a ton of international marketa etc. \n\nThe only thing being richly valued right now is mega cap tech stocks. Some nice charts visualizing the divergence of big tech growth: https://www.yardeni.com/pub/sp546relfun.pdf\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to argue that that‚Äôs the new normal looking at NVIDIAs PS ratio of 100.\n\nMy favourite is S&P400 crushing the big caps on fundamentals and returning less. This is mathematically not sustainable.', 'There are so many factors... I agree with supply/demand of investable assets being an issue as more people have more wealth. Demographics play here too.\n\nI also think the discussion about SP500 valuations needs to be broken into SP\\~495 and the big tech.\n\nIf you look at SP500 ex-big tech (FAANG-ish) then it\'s significantly more normally priced and also performing pretty poorly.\n\nYou can then make all sorts of optimistic or pessimistic claims about big tech. But for me, reality is that I see them eating the world and making incredible profits + growth no matter the economic condition. I think ""this time is different"" has been proven with them over the last 15-20 years and deserving a higher multiple... who knows if it continues.\n\nPoint being, I think people looking at market multiples without deconstructing analysis into specifically breaking out big tech are going to miss the story and jump to the conclusion that ""everything in US is overvalued"". It\'s very specific to a few mega cap companies.\n\nThere is a good analysis here: https://www.yardeni.com/pub/sap500ex45.pdf', 'https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/24033/wilshire5000-to-us-m2[https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/24033/wilshire5000-to-us-m2](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/34/us-stock-relative/24033/wilshire5000-to-us-m2)\n\nAn interesting way to view how much money is actually in the market is to divide total market cap by total amount of money in circulation. When doing that we see that there is about the same ratio as there was in ‚Äò08. However we‚Äôre nowhere near dot com levels of insanity. I think the prevalence of more retail can have an impact on individual/one off stocks but has limited impact on the market as a whole.', ""It's not new investors. . . it's the endless supply of money being printed by the government.  More money chasing the same amount of assets drives up prices."", 'For context the largest cap companies are now almost exclusively tech companies with absurdly high margins and great growth.\n\n20-30 years ago it was thin margin big box retailers, oil companies, and car manufacturers. \n\nThe economy as a whole has shifted.\n\nHell, even Walmart is turning into a high tech online retailer, which obviously would demand higher PE as it grows that part of the business.\n\nThat said I think a recent flight to ‚Äúvalue‚Äù (ie Costco, Coke, P&G) has distorted the actual value and still has to unwind, whether that‚Äôs via consolidating sideways or a dip to bring back P/E in line.', 'Sell off due to news and multi-month rally.

investing,"Is there any reason whatsoever that a ""smart beta"" ETF which has a long term track record of beating the S&P would be a bad investment long term?","So with my current living situation I'm able to invest about $3800 ever 4 weeks. This has led to me wanting to take the opportunity to diversify my portfolio with some ETFs other than the typical

One of my reasons is that I already invest a hefty amount into funds which have majority Apple and Microsoft. I don't want my entire life's and retirement savings to be 30% dependent on 2 stocks no matter what they are.

I have found many ETFs which buy S&P500 stocks based on various performance indicators. Some are quite speculative which doesn't interest me. But others are based on things such as quality factor, cash flow, volatility, etc.

A couple of examples are MOAT which is based on companies which have a wide moat, or competitive advantage, which would be difficult for competitors to overcome. Another is SPHQ which is based on quality factor.

Both of these ETFs have a 10 year return of higher than the S&P500 despite both being based on S&P stocks. They're just weighted and selected differently. Clearly this has been working and those strategies logically seem like they'd be successful

My question is why are these ETFs and others like them not as popular as the most common bulk, market cap weighted S&P ETFs? Their long term annualized returns obviously made the extra expense ratio worth it for the past decade. Their portfolios logically make sense to me. They do still own a lot of the same stocks just at lower percentages of the overall holdings

This seems like a no-brainer: they are more diversified with better long term track records. This seems too easy. What am I missing?

The main argument for investing 100% in the US is that the US has outperformed for about 100 years now. Investors look at that past performance as if it\'s predictive and seem to assume it will continue for the next hundred years. I think the US had an incredible 20th century, in the post war period particularly, and I\'m not sure we can reasonably expect to see that kind of explosive growth continue into the 21st century. \n\nI\'m not a doomer saying that the US is on the decline or anything like that.

Nope.  NOPE.  He suffered from the usual home country bias.  He was lucky and was born in U.S. at the right time.

It seems safer to keep the money in your home markets that will closely track your home inflation.  \n\nMy guess is that if you ran some Monte Carlo like analysis you\'d find that a diversified approach probably does better on average, but that bell curve also includes some bad outcomes where the international portion of your portfolio is effectively a total loss. Unfortunately we don\'t get the ""average"" outcome, we will only get one outcome and it could be a bad one.

Going all-in on a single factor in a single country that has happened to perform well in the past would be too stressful for me and I would likely not be able to resist tinkering if the US goes through another prolonged period of underperformance (e.g. as in 2000-2009).', 'No. Bogle was never an academic portfolio theorist to begin with']"

investing,Monthly portfolio performance calculations,"Hi all,

I'm working on setting up a spreadsheet in order to calculate the performance of my investment portfolio.

I'd like to have 2 calculations:

1. Using a time-weighted rate of return
2. Using a money-weighted rate of return

&#x200B;

For the time-weighted rate of return, I've setup the following:

&#x200B;

|Date|Beginning Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Ending Value|Daily Return|Daily Return +1|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|5|110|4.76%|104.76%|
|2 jan 2023|110|0|120|9.09%|109.09%|
|etc.||||||

Then I apply the formula =product(F:F)-1 to get the Time-weighted Return. The idea is that I can then use this to calculate the monthly and yearly TWR.

Is this the correct way to calculate this?

I wanted to use a similar approach to calculate the Money-weighted rate of return.

&#x200B;

|Date|Beginning value|Ending Value|Cashflow (deposit or withdrawal)|Net Cashflow|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1 jan 2023|100|120|5|25|
|2 jan 2023|120|130|0|10|
|3 jan 2023|130|120|\-5|\-15|
|etc.|||||

I wanted to use the XIRR formula to do something like =XIRR(E:E,A:A). However, I realise that the XIRR is an annual number. I'd like to calculate it per month as well.  


How would I go about this? I'd love to get some guidance. I believe especially my MWR table is flawed, but I can't figure out why exactly.

That will calculate the geometric **cumulative** return of the entire period, not the geometric mean (i.e. the average return, taking into account the effect of compounding) per period.\n\nFor example, if you had the daily returns for 3 days, you\'d need to raise the product of your daily returns (+1) to 1/3 then subtract 1.\n\nThe formula for TWRR is:     \nTWRR =  [(1+ R1) * (1+ R2) * ....(1+ Rn)] ^ (1/n) - 1\n\nWhere n is the number of periods, in this case number of days but could be number of months if you\'re using monthly periods etc.\n\nLet\'s say you had 45 days of returns (adjusting for any cash flows) and you added 1 to each to geometrically link them, your average daily return formula in Excel would be:\n\n=PRODUCT(A1:A45)^(1/45) - 1\n\nNow, if you wanted to find the average **monthly** return you\'d have to annualize your daily TWRR like such:\n\nAnnualized TWRR = (1 + Daily TWRR) ^ (365) - 1\n\nThen to find the monthly rate:\n\nMonthly TWRR = (1 + Annualized TWRR) ^ (1/12) - 1\n\nAgain, this gives you the geometric mean, which accounts for compounding, not the arithmetic mean, which does not. \n\nHope that helps!     \nCheers\n\nEDIT: Forgot about the MWRR.  You are correct in using the XIRR function but to be as accurate as possible, you\'ll want your starting balance (as a negative number), then the specific dates of all future cash flows (negative for deposits, positive for withdrawals) and then the final present value of the account and date. \n\nThis will indeed give you an annualized rate of return, taking into consideration the timing and size of your cash flows. \n\nTo convert this into a monthly rate, you can use the formula above in the same way:\n\nMonthly MWRR = (1 + XIRR) ^ (1/12) - 1\n\n\nAnd finally, if you wish to smooth out the volatility of your portfolio after a couple of years (or for various other reasons such as an investment with no cash flows, only the beginning and end value, such as what ETF historical returns show you over time when comparing them) you could use the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) which is a simple geometric average.  Useful for comparing your folio to a benchmark. \n\nCAGR = (End Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1/n) - 1\n\nwhere ""n"" is the number of years (with decimal is ok like 895 days / 365 = 2.45 years).

As you correctly noted, this is called the Geometric Mean or Geometric Average Return.  \n\nIf you instead just added the returns together (r1+ r2...+rn) and divided by the number of returns (n) this would give you the Arithmetic Mean, which would simply represent the average return per period without taking into account any compounding. Essentially, you are assuming here that returns are simply added together over time, rather than compounded.\n\nInvestopedia does not make this clear and is actually erroneous in its explanation since without raising to the n-th root you are only calculating the geometric **cumulative** return, not the geometric **average** return per period (days in your case).\n\nFurther, the geometric **cumulative** return, is a useful metric on its own since it shows your total return for the entire time period and also the effect of compounding. \n\nWhereas, if you just added the returns per day and didn\'t divide by the total number of returns, you\'d have your **arithmetic cumulative** return, which does not consider compounding. This tends to overstate your total return as it does not factor in the effect of a day with a negative return on the subsequent day. \n\nLet\'s look at a simple, but volatile example to illustrate why the geometric cumulative return is accurate and the arithmetic cumulative return ends up overstated, thus inaccurate:\n\nDay 0 Balance: $10\nDay 1 Return: +5%\nDay 2:  -2%\nDay 3: +25%\nDay 4:  -10%\nEnding Balance: $11.58\n\nArithmetic Cumulative Return = [0.05 - 0.02 + 0.25 - 0.10] = 0.18 or 18%\n\nGeometric Cumulative Return = [(1 + 0.05) * (1 - 0.02) * (1 + 0.25) * (1 - 0.10)] - 1 = 0.1576 or 15.76% \n\nThis makes more financial sense since your Day 0 balance will increase by 5% Day 1, then that new balance is your starting balance for Day 2 which then decreases by -2%, which is the starting balance for Day 3 and so on. \n\nWe can check this by (11.58 - 10) / 10 = 15.76% Return.\n\nIf it were 18% that equals $11.80 which =/= your true ending balance.    \n\n------\nNow, onto raising the Geometrically Linked Product to the\n 1/n.periods before subtracting 1.  \n\nTaking the nth root (1/n) finds the ""average"" growth factor for each period (i.e. days, weeks, months, whatever) that, if compounded over n periods, would give you the same final value. This accounts for the compounding effect of the returns.\n\nThe geometric mean is generally more appropriate for calculating linked returns over time since investments usually compound.     \n\nA simple but important reason for this is the fact that, for example, a 10% gain followed by a 10% loss does not leave you back where you started; rather, you\'d be at 99% of your original value. **The arithmetic mean would not capture this effect.**\n\nWe can illustrate this by continuing with our previous example where we left off at the cumulative arithmetic and geometric returns:\n\nArithmetic Mean = Cumulative Arithmetic Return / nper    \n= 0.18/4 = 0.045 or 4.5% \n\nGeometric Mean = (Geometric Linked Returns) ^ (1/nper) - 1    \n\n(1.1576) ^ (1/4) - 1 = 0.03726 or 3.73%     \n\nWe can see that a 3.73% geometric average return per day accurately accounts for compounding:\n\nBegin Balance: $10    \nDay 1 + 3.73% = $10.37\nDay 2 + 3.73% = $10.76   \nDay 3 + 3.73% = $11.16   \nDay 4 + 3.73% = $11.58 (Your Ending Balance from up above)   \n\nWe also see that 4.5% (arithmetic mean) is overstated. \n\nI hope this helps and doesn\'t make things seem more confusing! I tried to break it down piece by piece but may have gone too granular.  I thought it was necessary however, since investopedia is not only confusing but also wrong in the way it attempts to explain this.       \nYou\'ll find that every financial app, broker and performance calculator modifies this in all kinds of convoluted ways as well.  Partially understandable since timing and size of cash flows, how dividends are handled, and how inter-account transfers are recorded will complicate things when looking for your MWRR.     \n\nNot to mention many ETFs and funds tend to report the arithmetic mean or CAGR instead of a properly geometrically linked TWRR since it bumps up the returns a few bps or points.\n\n\nIn the end it\'s really about what these metrics will do for you and for me, it\'s a matter of consistency, and benchmarking not only the performance of the investments I choose but also my own performance of when I choose to buy/sell and how optimal my position sizing is (hopefully improving!) since my method of investing is a mix of ETFs and factor tilts using individual stocks. \n\nApologies for length and poor formatting! Lmk if you have other Qs. \n\nCheers', "">For the MWRR, would I be able to use the same format as the TWRR?\n\nNo, not if you have irregular cash flows by date and size. Calculating the MWRR is kind of a pain in Excel. It's much easier to manage with a Python script or something of that nature. \n\nFor MWRR, you are only concerned with your starting balance (expressed as a negative number) and date, and then all future cash flows. Let's say your account inception was 1/1/2023 and you deposited $1000.    \n\nYour sheet would begin:   \nA1                B1\n1/1/2023    -1000\n\nThen, every date there is a cash flow (a deposit/buy [negative]  or a **take profit**/withdrawal OUT of account [positive]).  If both happened in one day then you add the neg deposit to the pos withdrawal for your net cash flow. Such as:    \n\n1/12/2023    -250 (deposit or buy, depending when you wish to count the cash flow)\n\n2/23/2023    400 (sell, take profit, withdrawal)\n\n4/5/2023    -500 deposit, 200 withdrawal = -300 net cash flow.\n\nRepeat on and on.  \n\nNow, any time you wish to know your MWRR, let's say at the end of April so 4/30/2023, you simply check your balance for that day.  Let's say it's $2500. \n\nIn Excel:\n\n4/30/2023   2500 (always positive bc you are pretending you cashed out)\n\nFinally, you'll use the XIRR function:  =XIRR(B1:B4, A1:A4)\n\n**This will return for you the ANNUALIZED RATE OF RETURN, regardless of whether it's been 4.3 months or 2 years etc). You will need to convert this output to the period of your choice using the formulas in my original comment if you want to know the Monthly Annualized Rate of Return, or the Weekly and so on.**\n\nThe XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) calculates the return rate which would make the net present value of all your cash flows (both inflows and outflows) equal to zero. It is especially useful when there are multiple and irregular cash flows (deposits and withdrawals).\n\nTip (or rats nest depending how you look at it lol):\n\nCAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and XIRR (aka Money Weighted Rate of Return MWRR)  are similar in that they are used to calculate the returns of your investment over a period of time, but CAGR is a simpler geometric average. \n\nIt gives you the mean annual growth rate of your investment assuming it has been compounding over the period (at least 1 year) and **it smooths out returns and ignores volatility.**\n\n It's best used when returns are reinvested _and no cash flows in or out except for the initial and final cash flows_\n\nThe Excel function for CAGR is =RRI (Return Rate of Investment).\n\nI use this over long time frames (a year or more). Say, 3 years, 4 months and 6 days.  I calculate that time span as total days/365 to get my period length. Then simply enter my beginning  account value and current account value. (Technically named PV & FV).\n\nThis will give a smooth ballpark annual growth rate but it is not as precise and useful as the geometric mean or TWRR, or XIRR.  But it's good for comparing very different investments on a kinda level playing field over time.  \n\n(I'll come back and check for any errors here.  Always DYOR. I haven't double checked this reply for 100% accuracy yet FYI)\n\nCheers!""]"

investing,Swedish Conglomerate tumbles 30% in the stock market,"Storskogen is a conglomerate or an **international group of businesses** across trade, industry, and services operating in a decentralized model to acquire and develop market-leading niche companies.

It reported 2Q 2023 this week and was **trading at -28% from previous day close**

Here is a summary of Storskogen's financial performance based on their second quarter 2023 earnings release:

|Financial Metric|Q2 2022|Q2 2023|Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|SEK 9,059M|SEK 9,462M|\+4%|
|Adjusted EBITA|SEK 877M|SEK 922M|\+5%|
|Operating Profit|SEK 681M|SEK 605M|\-11%|
|Operating Margin|7.5%|6.4%|\-1.1pp|
|Net Income|SEK 474M|SEK 115M|\-76%|
|EPS|SEK 0.25|SEK 0.04|\-83%|

\- **Profit** for the period **fell 76%** to SEK 115 million.

\- The Trade business area saw lower consumer demand affecting sales and profits. The Services business area improved thanks to high occupancy rates. Industry continued to perform well.

\- Cash flow from operating activities increased significantly to SEK 852 million from SEK 335 million last year.- Net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained stable at 2.6x.

Overall, Storskogen delivered modest top line growth but profits declined amid a tougher economic climate mainly affecting consumer sentiment. The company maintained a strong financial position and cash flows improved markedly. Storskogen continues to focus on cash flow generation and profitability in the near term.

It is a good business and management seem to have a good track record in the field. Let's breakdown in simple words how they make money:

>*Storskogen* is a conglomerate that owns a portfolio of small and medium-sized businesses across three segments - **Trade, Industry, and Services.**  
>  
>The **Trade** segment includes distributors and wholesalers of physical products like home furnishings, health and beauty items, sports equipment, etc. This segment generates revenue by selling these products to retailers or directly to consumers.  
>  
>The **Industry** segment contains traditional industrial companies involved in manufacturing, automation, and technology services. These companies make money by producing and selling various industrial products and solutions.  
>  
>The **Services** segment provides business-to-business services in areas like contracting, infrastructure, installation, logistics, and more. Revenue comes from selling these services to other businesses.  
>  
>Storskogen aims to acquire profitable niche businesses in these segments and help them grow further under its ownership. The operating companies charge their customers for the products or services provided.  
>  
>At the parent level, Storskogen derives profits from the earnings of all the operating businesses it owns. By having a diversified portfolio across segments, Storskogen can maintain stable cash flows as some segments may perform better than others in different market conditions.So in summary, Storskogen generates revenue through the sales of its underlying business units and creates shareholder value by acquiring, growing and operating a diverse mix of companies. The decentralized model allows each unit to focus on its respective industry and customers.

investing,How to determine value in small cap/newer companies?,"So I‚Äôve recently stumbled upon Jupiter Wellness. Started trading publicly in 2020, 25 million market cap, negative earnings but 50%+ year over year growth in revenue. 

They are a health and wellness research team and I see potential in a sunscreen they are making that protects against jellyfish stings, as well as a merger with a company that is making a drink that rapidly reduces alcohol levels in the system. I work in spirits and the second one has the chance to grow into a $100 million a year brand. Buuuut‚Ä¶.

Any advice on how to look at small cap companies like this from a numbers standpoint to help make a better decision, or is it purely speculative this early on and just rolling the dice ?","['Jupiter Wellness looks terrible as a company to me. Its website is all over the place. The first thing it says when you land on the page is ""New Solutions For The Treatment Of  \nSKIN AND HAIR METABOLISM AND WOMEN\'S SEXUAL HEALTH"" \\[caps on website\\], then when I read the first press announcement it said ""Jupiter Wellness Closes Acquisition Of Safety Shot, Plans To Change Company Name And Focus On Launch Of World‚Äôs First Rapid Blood Alcohol Detox Drink"".... so you have a microcap company that is announcing announcement about different products it\'s trying to put out, it seems like it doesn\'t have a business.\n\nYou need to be trained, learn and get experience to determine the value of a small-cap/newer company.

If they have any kind of trouble around them it might be a pump-and-dump scheme.  Then google their product. The product you like NoStingz is sold at Amazon and Walmart online:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/NoStingz-Jellyfish-Protectant-Biodegradable-sunscreen/dp/B09YL4P2JL#customerReviews](https://www.amazon.com/NoStingz-Jellyfish-Protectant-Biodegradable-sunscreen/dp/B09YL4P2JL#customerReviews)\n\nIt only has 39 reviews on Amazon most of which are free reviews from people from a site called ""Vine"" that get a free product in return for reviewing. On a gut-check level, unless I\'m missing something about swimming in Florida, I can only think of the most over-protective parent as wanting to buy a dual sun-screen jellyfish protection product.

There are several lawsuits in which he is involved with former business partners. He also started at a company called ""Stratton Oakmont"" which was the notorious penny stock-pushing fraud brokerage immortalized in ""Wolf of Wall Street"", so in other words, the CEO has made his career by promoting penny stocks.... this is VERY bad. \n\n[https://casetext.com/case/caro-capital-llc-v-koch-5](https://casetext.com/case/caro-capital-llc-v-koch-5)\n\nSo far Brian John has sold nearly $700k worth of Jupiter Wellness\'s Stock:\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/sec/insider-trades/jupw/brian-john](https://www.benzinga.com/sec/insider-trades/jupw/brian-john)\n\nNow I\'ll take a little look at the financials. I actually usually start there but due to the Sunscreen + Jelly Fish product you talked about I started by looking at the company\'s products. Just looking at the May 12th quarterly report. There was a staggering $52 million deficit for the year. The company\'s auditors even made a note about worrying whether the business could continue:  \n\n\n""Going Concern Consideration  \n   \nAs of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company had accumulated deficits of $51,905,848 and $50,597,674, respectively, and cash flow used in operations of $1,469,427, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and $6,395,942 and $7,567,645 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its expansion and development plans. As of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company had $3,737,259 and $1,931,068, respectively, in cash and working capital of $4,367,081 and $2,245,979, respectively. These conditions have raised doubt about the Company‚Äôs ability to continue as a going concern as noted by our auditors, M&K CPAS, PLLC.""\n\nSo without needing to get too far down this rabbit hole. It looks like this company will probably go bust unless it can raise some serious money. The business would need to make at least $50 million or so to be at break-even, and for some insane reason, it has a current valuation of $ 25 million. In the last 10Q, the business had revenue of $1.1 mil and operating profits of $246K, unfortunately the business incurred a net loss of $1.3 million. For some reason it costs nearly $1.5 million in G&A to run the business for 3 months, it must be the jelly fish catching program that\'s running up the cost?   \n\n\nThe cashflow position is terrible, the business lost $1.3 million in cash in the 3 months up to March 2023. Overall the business lost 1.4 million in cash in its net operating activities but raised $3.5 million in a stock offering (yay dilution) which it used to make an acquisition. \n\nOverall I see very little chance or hope of you or anyone except the insiders making any money on this business.

investing,ELI5 - expense ratio on Fidelity Money market funds,"I‚Äôve been looking for a HYSA to put about $25k in for a rainy day fund. It‚Äôs becoming really obnoxious to wade through the qualifications for these 5%+ APY accounts (i.e. transactions required, deposits required per month, amount to keep promo rates).

I saw someone mention in another post that they use fidelity money market funds instead of HYSA. The expense ration on these accounts are really high vs ETF‚Äôs (.4%~). I‚Äôm used to seeing ETFs at .02%-.09%. 

Here‚Äôs my questions:

1- Why is the expense ration so much higher?

2- Is there an expense ratio on HYSA‚Äôs, other than potential fees the bank may have? I haven‚Äôt seen one but digging through the terms is confusing.

3- ELI5 expense ratios in general. 

4- Most importantly, suggestions for either banks or other options to hold money that‚Äôs easy to access, while still making a decent return on the money.

Thanks in advance.","[""An important thing to remember with money market funds (and ETFs) is that when you're comparing their quoted yields (7-day SEC yield, 30-day SEC yield), those already take into account the expense ratio. \n\nSo for example:\n\n- [SPAXX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31617H102) (Fidelity): Expense ratio 0.42%, 7-day yield 4.97%\n- [SWVXX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swvxx) (Schwab): Expense ratio 0.34%, 7-day yield 5.16%\n- [VMFXX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx) (Vanguard): Expense ratio 0.11%, 7-day yield 5.24%\n\nOver the last 7 days, each of those money market funds yielded that annual rate, AFTER taking out those expenses.\n\nVanguard is known for pioneering index funds and low fees. Schwab and Fidelity are known more for customer service."", ""1. SPRXX has an expense ratio of 0.42%, which is in line with what you should normally expect for a money market fund. Vanguard's VMFXX is an outlier at 0.11% - I guess this is because Vanguard has always prioritized getting operating costs as low as possible.\n2. No. When you put money in a bank, you are effectively loaning the bank money, with the expectation that they will pay you back whenever you want. They make a profit by loaning your money with interest to other people, or buying long-term financial assets. By contrast, a money market fund is a financial asset that you buy, and the people who manage that asset make a profit by skimming a little bit of its value off the top. The expense ratio is the proportion of the total value of the asset that they skim off the top each year.\n3. \\^\\^\n4. Don't try too hard to earn a return on your rainy day fund. Earning a return requires taking risk, and the whole point of this money is to protect you from risk. Put your money in a reputable FDIC insured bank account and don't worry about it - it's not hard to find a bank that pays around 4 - 4.5% these days, and that's plenty. if you're saving and investing money every month then before long $25k will be a minor portion of your net worth."", ""[VUSXX](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/XNAS/VUSXX/quote) has an ER of 0.09%\n\n3) an expense ratio expresses how much of a percent the company takes out of your gains as the cost of doing business.  you've given your money to them to manage and put it to work.  they take a cut."", ""I'll take a stab at replying.  \n\nSimply stated, the expense ratio is the cost the investor pays for the operating cost, including management, of the account as part of the funds assets.  \n\nPassive funds typically follow a market index or invest in large companies that require very little management, so the fees are usually lower.  \n\nActively managed funds have higher fees, but because they are actively managed may also produce higher net returns. \n\nReviewing which offers the higher return history inclusive of fees will assist you in making a choice.  ETFs typically have a list of related companies they invest in and the management is therefore usually limited to weighting of the underlying tickers.   Mutual funds may have a broader focus from market sectors, international countries, business categories, etc. which may require a lot more analysis and management."", 'The expense ratio is much higher compared to ETFs because MMF are more active than an ETF which will cost more.

investing,"Are bonds an obvious investment now, if you believe that we will return to the 2010-1019 interest rate regime?","Bonds are historically mediocre at returning positive real yields, which is why I've avoided them.  But it seems to me that using bonds to bet on an interest rate reversion seems promising.

Here are the premises, as I see them:

* 30 year T-bonds are paying [4.45%](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us)

* The Fed is seeking to return to 2% inflation.  During the 2010-2019 pre-covid era, at this inflation level, [30 year bond yields were about 1.5-2%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS30)

* There are good reasons to believe that the current episode of inflation is an economic readjustment from covid era shifts in demand, not a consequence of pre-covid low rates.

* If I use the zero-coupon bond equation value for interest rate r, par value V, years Y: Price=*P=V/(1+r)^Y* I get the following 30 year 3-year-holding period  nominal-dollar profits for holding bonds through an interest rate shift from rate r1 to r2, as *Profit = [(1+r2)^(Y-3)/(1+r1)^(Y)]-1*

    * +116% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 'normal' level of 2% after 3 years

    * +66% profit if 30 year bond rates drop to 3% after 3 years

    * 1.2% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 5% after 3 years

    * 23.5% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 6% after 3 years

    * 40% loss if 30 year bond rates rise to 7% after 3 years

If one is afraid of inflation during the holding period, one could pay a similar game with TIPS, which yield over 2%, but for recent history have tended to [cluster around 1%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII30).   In this case, buying TIPS at 2% and selling in 3 years at a 1% rate would yield a 38% real-dollar profit, or about 11% a year.

Personally, I think that it is far more likely for rates to hold steady or fall back to 2%, because the 2009 to 2020 2% inflation era seemed to work OK economically.

So under this reasoning, the sensible strategy might be to bail  out of stocks, pile into long-term T-bonds, and get back into stocks if and when stock prices (P/E) readjust to more closely reflect the traditional 4% equity risk premium, roughly   P/E=1/(2% real  bond yield + 4% equity risk premium )=17.  Or even if P/E doesn't fall, holding bonds through an interest rate decline would give one a lot more money to put into modestly historically overpriced stocks.

I mean I think corporate bonds with maturity in 5-10 years are probably the best way to play this to minimize inversion, while capturing a good amount of benefits from rates falling to 3.50%-4.00% FFR over the next 1-3 years, thats what the market is saying anyway', ""Just because inflation may be gone soon doesn't mean we are going back to the previous ultra low rates and QE. Your entire analysis is based on a fallacy. Compared to various points in history, interest rates right now are actually still fairly low."", 'To me there is no financial magic other than Inflation that will combat out deficit issues under the weight of current spending & entitlements. I expect real Inflation to run rampant for the next decade+ and bonds to return negative real yields.', 'How much of the current wave of inflation do you think is driven by climate change policies? \n\nI would guess quite a bit, particularly across resource intensive industries', ""Long duration bonds are likely undervalued if you are willing to hold for at least a year. Fed SEP shows long term real GDP of 1.6-2.5% and inflation at 2%. According to Taylor Rule, long yields are at the upper end of the range (4.4%) and aren't priced for any sort of economic slowdown happening, which is fair because there is no recession in the data. However, 4.4% long yields already assumes investors are demanding 2% real yields. Keep in mind that in 2019, when FFR was 2.5%, investors only demanded 1% real yields as long yields hardly ever went past 3%. For long yields to increase from here then you would need long run GDP growth to be 3%, inflation 3% and investors demanding 2% real yields, which I think is unlikely. The post-pandemic boom is creating a temporary spike in growth and inflation and long yields are not only at pre-pandemic but already at pre-2008 levels. Ignoring short term pressures like gov't treasury offerings and global events adding forced treasury selling, this suggests investors have already priced a Fed keeping rates higher for longer and any signal of mean reversion to post-2008 or slowdown in real GDP to less than 2% would mean lower long duration yields."", '2% isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù', 'If I were going to gamble with my future, this would be my bet.

The feedback loop dynamics of the economy are not fully accurately modelled by anyone, it is an impossible task. But I think it's reasonable to believe that the delayed & cumulative effect of all the rate hikes won't be apparent until much later, resulting in a very delayed economic signal being read back. Delayed feedback systems tend to be very difficult to control.\nSo if one believes rate hike overshoot is likely, then that same person may also believe that bonds are an obvious investment right now ;)""]"

like if an ETF is trading slightly above value and a separate ETF is at normal value and they track the same thing then arbitrage the difference (but much more complicated).

Also, in order to keep risk under control you usually have to use derivatives to hedge your exposure to the underlying assets, and this gets pretty complicated.\n\nBecause of all this, you usually only see these strategies at big, well capitalized firms.

wallstreetbets,"I just spent two months in China. Don't believe the CCP reporting 21% youth unemployment, it is definitely way, way higher.","[So I'm a Mandarin-speaking Asian dude from Texas. **This is all anecdotal, so this is only my first-hand observations. Feelings are useless in trading. You are a moron if you trade off a story versus hard facts**.] I was in Beijing for a wedding, then was a tourist through Chengdu and Harbin and various villages in between.

**First, locals are freaked out the CCP is so embarrassed youth unemployment is over 21% that they will stop reporting the number starting the next month.** For reference, places like Japan, South Korea and the US are at 5 to 7% youth unemployment, UK at 10%, EU at 14%. Twenty one puts China in the same territory as fucking Lebanon. Heard many an angry rant against the government by middle-age and older parents behind closed doors talking about how their adult kids are unemployed even with a C9 university degree. I met many, many food cart vendors and Meituan (food delivery app) dudes on ebikes who just graduated from a top school. This on top of all the quiet quitting and ""lying flat"" people I met who are just giving up and not looking for steady work. Several parents told me how the old cushy government jobs for grads are drying up because cities are all teetering on bankruptcy due to the growth-at-all-costs spending and debt of the past 20 years.

**Second, these shady fucks are not reporting unemployed migrant workers from rural areas. There's got to be millions of these people.** I thought migrants were reported after the CCP revamped their labor reporting standards in 2019, but the business owners and university faculty I met and talked to said it is all bullshit, there is no way to track them. I stayed at a friend's flat near central Chengdu and every morning there were hundreds of migrant day laborers at the truck depot across the street waiting for trucks and vans to drive up looking for cheap labor. Shit was wild, there would be literally fistfights over who would pile into each truck. Reminded me of the Honduran, Mexican and Salvadorian migrants back in Dallas who line up near Home Depots looking for day work, sans violence. The day labor dudes I talked to in those mobs in Chengdu and Beijing were almost all former construction workers who are now doing day work or gig jobs because all the construction jobs are gone thanks to the imploding real estate market (see Evergrande bankruptcy). They told me the day labor crowds were easily 3x bigger right after COVID but the work was so rare that folks packed up and returned to their villages when they ran out of money. Multiple that a couple hundred times, who knows how many unemployed ppl aren't being counted.

**Another big problem no one is talking about that I noticed - China made working construction over 50 illegal.** So now there's millions up on millions of people over that age trying to fill other service jobs even before COVID. Thanks to the One Child Policy and non-existent government benefits, there aren't the large family safety nets that other Asian countries have so I could see with my own eyes many older folks with no savings already falling through the cracks.

Shit is fucked. **I've been to China a few times since 2000 and this is the first time I could see and hear deep structural stress on the economy and society.** China has always felt like the Wild West to me because there's just so many people there living on top of each other that everyone just looks out for themselves. Even before COVID, I rarely saw common courtesies like the waiting in line and not being rude to strangers. That selfishness still exists but is now on hyperdrive since people don't have easy access to jobs anymore. I'm curious how Xi is going to keep people in line when the wheels come off completely. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.


**edit. LOL someone referred me to Reddit Cares for this post. Don't worry, I don't plan on ever travelling back to China, I decided awhile ago this would be my last trip. I have zero family there and the friend I stayed with in Chengdu is a non-Chinese expat. I love Chinese people and culture, that is why I kept going back.

I‚Äôve already factored in a 13k standard deduction, 6.5k IRA deduction, 3k carry over loss deduction. Yet I will still owe around 50k when combining fed and state tax. This is too much money. 

My first thought was I could get a 7.5k tax credit if I buy a Tesla, but I don‚Äôt qualify for that anymore since I‚Äôm over the income limit.

I am prepared to flee the country and live abroad forever while I keep yoloing. After a few years they‚Äôll probably try to come after me, but I‚Äôd be living in Mexico or something.

wallstreetbets,MY (f19) BF (22M) JERKED OFF TO THE STOCK MARKET??," 

I know the title sounds deranged, but I swear to god im not a troll. Here‚Äôs the context:

My bf and I are long distance, so we used to have plenty of phone sex, however, that‚Äôs been happening less and less often as our relationship has gone on (according to him, he just doesn‚Äôt feel as horny as often anymore). We‚Äôve met and had relations irl a few times, and he‚Äôs always the kind to last very long in bed, and during phone sex as well. I used to be insecure about it, thinking that maybe it was something wrong with me, but hes genuinely a great bf who constantly assures me, and has never once said anything bad about our sex life.

It should be noted that he watches plenty of porn (as do I), and neither of us see that as an issue, so this isnt about him hiding porn from me or something. We were calling today, and I was playing a game on my phone (papa‚Äôs cupcakeria, you can‚Äôt make this shit up), and after about twenty minutes of us doing our own thing, he suddenly goes ‚Äúim done‚Äù and shows me his cum????? Obviously, I get really confused and ask how the hell he was jerking off this whole time without me realising (we were on video call), before mentioning that I thought he was looking at the stock market (he spends his free time just staring at the stock market for hours on end like a lunatic, but I love him so it‚Äôs whatever).

Tell me why this man then looks me in the eyes and goes ‚Äúyeah, I was looking at the stock market, I was too lazy to look for porn.‚Äù

It then hits me that he literally just CAME to the stock market. When I point this out to him, all he said in response was ‚Äúit‚Äôs a man thing, I didn‚Äôt wanna bother you while you were playing your game‚Äù and told me not to worry about it.

Now, I don‚Äôt want to sound insane, but I got a bit upset, because in my head, he could have very easily asked to have phone sex with me, but chose to literally jerk off to the stock market instead. To add insult to injury, he came REALLY quickly (like significantly quicker than he would during anything involving me) which makes me feel like SHIT, because there is no way the goddamn stock market is somehow more stimulating than his own damn girlfriend.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm not super genuinely upset, but you‚Äôve gotta admit this shits gonna hurt your pride if it happened to you. I honest to god have no idea how to even move forward after this, and I just needed to type this out, because no one would believe me otherwise üíÄ","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: my bf came to the stock market, and when I asked why he chose that over phone sex with me, he said it‚Äôs a ‚Äúman thing‚Äù and that he was ‚Äútoo lazy to look for porn.‚Äù', 'You can dress as his favorit stock', 'What did I half just read', '![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)', 'I just jerked off to reading about someone who jerked off to the stock market', 'This is the realest thing I‚Äôve ever seen', ""The only thing I don't believe about this is that a WSB member has a girlfriend."", 'What exactly of the stock market is arousing?

wallstreetbets,I actually did it (lost 10k. I make 21k/yr),"So, I‚Äôve made a few moves on the market. Turned a few hundred into $1800. Then, about 2k to 5k ‚Äî with what, you guessed it‚Ä¶ options. 

After my recent winnings, I thought, ‚Äúwow, with 5k I can really take big swings at the market now.‚Äù

And I did. I swung my way down to being on the wrong side of every trade for like a month. I had one week where I bled every day just picking stocks that ended up trending up on the week. 

That means I picked the few days stocks dropped great. Eventually, my risk tolerance built back up. The 4.5k I still had felt like zero. 

So guess what I did. After seeing some shit banks bounce back, I bought $4000 worth of calls on PACW only for it to dive after news if it‚Äôs purchase. 

I was down 70ish percent in that trade, but I had to hunger trading more than a few hundred dollars. So I took out a small personal loan that was advertised on credit karma from discover.  It was worth 16k and has a13% rate. 

I put it all into PayPal. Lost money. Pulled it out. I put half into Lucid. Lost money. Shopify. Lost money. 

I was so scared to keep losing that I kept selling credit stocks bounced back up. Losing money on upward trending stocks. 

I was down to 14k. Then I held overstocks calls. They bled me so I sold. It popped the next days. I was down $3000. 

11k

Bought vroom last week. Dropped. 

9.7k

Bought lucid today. 

Dropped. 

8.6k

wallstreetbets,Learned what early assignment is today ü•≤,"Since I very clearly have no idea what I'm doing, I've been playing around with what I __thought__ were low risk spreads to get a feel for things. Ya know, like the ones that show a max profit of $5,000 and max loss of $5 - cause that's safe...right? ü´† 

I obviously was not expecting to hit max profits on these by _any_ stretch of the imagination. Rather, I spent hours upon hours reading Robinhood's resources and scrolling through different strategy types, legs, strike prices, dates, etc trying to wrap my head around what I was looking at. Eventually, I decided I was content with paying a few bucks ($2 and $8 for these long put calendar spreads, to be exact) to see something through from start to end in real time. Spend $10 to get some hands on experience today, skip the Starbucks run tomorrow; no harm, no foul. Seemed totally logical at the time. 

What _really_ tripped me up was the spreads with $0 cost. Completely mind boggling to me that a play could profit so much as $10 (let alone multiple thousands, if a miracle happened of course) without having to risk a single penny. Like why wouldn't everyone be doing that?!

wallstreetbets,Buy Long Dated SPY calls and join the military is a guaranteed winning strategy.,"Within the next 4-5 years, there are 3 possible scenarios.

WW3 didn't happen. You serve for 4 yrs. Got about 100K saved, since you don't have much need for spending in the army, and you can't YOLO FDs with your life saving. I say 100K is reasonable. Better yet, your long calls are deep ITM and US is prospering. So you can straight up retire after your service.

WW3 did happen, and US won. Same as above, and you can retire even more comfortably.

WW3 did happen, and US lost (or lost global dominance in any capacity). Well, just die on the battlefield, and you still don't have to worry about money again. And you will be remembered as a brave soldier instead of some guy sucking dicks behind Wendy's.

I see this as a Win-Win-Win situation.

Same with my best friend who was in the Air Force. Now, they\'re both out and more conservative about spending, but while they were in, we lived it up. Good times...', ""If you're enlisted, you're grossly over estimating the amount of money you're going to save.  Unless you have quite a bit of time in, the pay is pretty mediocre.  There are a lot of costs to being in the military, or potential costs, that roadblock savings quite a bit.\n\n1. If you want to get married, you're moving every three years.  Good luck having your spouse do anything other than being a server or at walmart.  They work remote?  Maybe a lucky break, but I'm guessing you're screwed.  So you're supporting a family on your shitty minimal income, with maybe some supplementation.  Good luck, lots of dirt poor NCOs out there.\n2. Great you're committed to staying single!  You can live on base (if there's space) for free, and get a fair amount of food, also free, at the DFAC.  Army food fucking sucks, after you get done with 10 months of powdered eggs in training you'll be praying for a ride to the Green Bean coffee place for something that resembles actual food (resembles, b/c it's still fast food garbage).  So, you're getting no 'extra' money for food and using your meagre income to go out to eat because if you're in the barracks (lower enlisted, single) - there's no kitchen.\n3. Ok, you're a literal monk.  You eat the DFAC food, you live in the asbestos filled, lead painted barracks.  You save every cent.  You get a uniform allowance but it doesn't cover things like, your company is out in the field 1/2 of the month every month - and you can't wear shitty uniforms in garrison - so you're shelling out $70-$100 for new patches/uniforms all the time, plus you gotta pay for cleaning since the barracks doesn't have a laundry facility.  Gotta buy boots at rates that are higher than you're getting paid for them (sure, you don't have to buy oakleys with soft soles, just wear the army issued hard soles until they wear down to about a 30 degree angle, I'm sure you won't spend most of your time as some kind of sick call ranger.  Luckily they'll give you lots of motrin 800s to help with your quickly developing ankle, knee, and back problems.  Also, remember, you're living in the barracks; and there's only one thief in the army; everyone else is just trying to get their shit back.  So, the books, games, handheld devices, phones, air pods, food, beer, gaterade, uniforms you carefully spend your money on are gone all the fucking time.  You've got a padlock on your foot chest?  Buddy, I've been out for 12 years and I still have the three bolt cutters I left with.\n4. Travel,  assuming you have friends or family.  You're going to get block leave once a year, some vacation times, 4 day passes.  Airfare, driving, whatever.  You're going to be in shithole places like Ft. Polk, Ft. Sill, Ft. Leanordwood, Ft. Hood - you're family lives on the west coast, the east coast, whatever.  So you visit twice a year - you've got good savings, whatever - as  specialist you're probably blowing a month + wage on plane tickets and incidentals (each trip).\n\nI could go on, about the long hours (you're definitely making under minimum wage), the shitty living conditions, how much it sucks to show up to work if you're in a bad unit (and there's nothing you can do about it except go to prison, so fucking suck it up), the health conditions you'll accumulate from leadership that loves to do 12+ mile marches with 60lb rucks (because they're fucking huah) all the time.  Taking a shit in 115 degree heat in a porta john where the turd from your ass gently kisses the mound of shit piled up below before it disconnects, but whatever, you do you.  We haven't even gotten to longer term, keeping up with the friends you made, and watching them die of kidney failure at 42, 1/4 of them killing themselves (my personal experience), or end up on disability after getting blown up.  If you don't escape an MOS where you're getting shot at, or deployed; you can also look forward to that.  If you think it's easy to come back to a very politically correct society after your deployement... I've got some stock to sell you.\n\nGood luck, I mean it sincerely.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that the Army, and training can suck in ways that you can't even imagine as an average person.  Getting 1-3 hours of sleep at inprocessing where everyone gets one set of PTs, you shower and get back into them,  wait in line for 12-13 hours a day getting yelled at and doing pushups for literally hours, watching people walk by with their shoelaces pulled out after threatening to kill themselves so they can get a medical discharge.  Waking up to someone drinking bleach and vomiting blood mid basic because they can't handle it.  Falling asleep in a hole you dug while fire ants are biting you - and you just don't care.  I'm only on week 6 stuff here.  There's some cool shit, like shooting AT4s, M203s, and whatever - but for every two minutes of cool you spend months just embracing the suck."", 'There is alot to digest here.

wallstreetbets,"The market is not collapsing, you are just being ground into a fine powder by automation and AI","No offense to the truck driver man who can't spell diesel correctly, but the market is not ""collapsing"". You just think so because your piece of the pie, already minuscule, is being absorbed by larger corporate forces warring with each other in a battle to control and take everything.

I work in the entertainment businesses. While I empathize with the WGA and SAG strikers, they're fucked. The studios know that they have complete control at this point with technology and that human people and their talents have been GREATLY devalued. AI can write a play set in the 1960s based off a Stephen King novel in the tone of Hemingway in 3 seconds... And the technology is only improving at a rapid pace. Also the average quality of netflix shows is a joke, some of these writers SHOULD consider other careers... but they're dressed up as pickachu and princess mononoke picketing in front of paramount studios as if it was a comicon event. It's sad, Bob Iger is probably laughing at these fools.

Truck drivers will be replaced by self driving vehicles. Customer service is already being replaced by AI. Amazon uses AI chat bots to deal with customer service, and soon AI will be able to use realistic sounding voices to talk you through your problems, so even Indians in call centers will be out of work.

Within a decade, or sooner. You will be able to create ANY film, tv show, book, novel, play, picture, painting, VR experience, etc with a click of a button. Any viewing experience you can imagine will be able to be generated. You can just put yourself as the main character in a brand new AI generated fast and furious film if you want, you, with your face, can star in a new transformers film. AI is completely changing the way we consume media and the studios KNOW this.

THAT is why the studios are not backing down. If we step back even further, other giant companies are also not backing down. They have the peasants by the balls and it's not pretty. When the great wall of china was being built, laborers who were too tired or ill to continue working were literally ground into the cement mix and put INTO the wall itself.

That is what is happening to you. The market is not collapsing, but the the people at the bottom it probably feels like that because they are being ground into cement to build the great wall of global capitalism.","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Things are going to get much worse for you, sorry.', ""As long as AI can't fuck your mother I'll never be out of work"", 'Did an AI write this?

wallstreetbets,Credit card debt hits $1T for the first time ever,"Americans are increasingly turning to their credit cards to cover  everyday expenses, with debt surpassing $1 trillion for the first time  at the end of June, according to a New York Federal Reserve report  published Tuesday.¬†

In the three-month period from April to June,  total credit card debt surged to $1.03 trillion, an increase of $45  billion, or 4.6% from the previous quarter. It marks the highest level  on record in Fed data dating back to 2003.

The rise in credit card usage and debt is particularly concerning because interest rates  are astronomically high right now. The average credit card annual  percentage rate, or APR, hit a new record of 20.33% last week, according  to a Bankrate database that goes back to 1985. The previous record was  19% in July 1991.

If people are carrying debt to compensate for steeper prices, they  could end up paying more for items in the long run. For instance, if you  owe $5,000 in debt ‚Äì which the average American does ‚Äì current APR  levels would mean it would take about 277 months and $7,723 in interest  to pay off the debt making the minimum payments.¬†

""One  trillion dollars in credit card debt is staggering,"" said Matt Schulz,  chief credit analyst at LendingTree. ""Unfortunately, it is likely only  going to keep growing from here.""

The increase in the credit card  category helped to push total household debt to a staggering $17.06  billion, a 0.1% increase from the first three months of 2023. Balances  are now $2.9 trillion higher than they were at the end of 2019, before  the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Auto loan balances also contributed to the uptick, climbing by $20  billion or 4.3% over the course of the second quarter. Student loan  debt, meanwhile, declined by $35 billion while mortgage  balances¬†remained largely unchanged at $12 trillion, despite an uptick  in mortgage originations.

While  delinquency rates remain relatively small, there was an uptick in  borrowers who are struggling with credit card and auto loan payments. As  of June, about 2.7% of outstanding debt was in some stage of  delinquency, up slightly from the 2.6% recorded the previous quarter.  That remains 2 percentage points lower than the pre-pandemic level.¬†

But the fact that there is any semblance of delinquency rates rising  during such a strong labor market is concerning. Experts have warned the  rate may begin to climb higher as student loan payments resume in the  fall after the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's forgiveness  plan.¬†

""Even as inflation has lingered and interest rates have  risen, pushing card debt to record levels, Americans have generally done  a good job paying their credit card bills on time,"" Schulz said.

""That  may not last, however. The resumption of student loan payments will be a  huge test for many cardholders, shrinking the amount they have to  devote to paying off card debt and leaving some people simply unable to  make minimum payments at all.""

The rise in balances comes in the midst of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate-hike campaign as it tries to crush stubborn inflation and cool the economy.¬†

wallstreetbets,"Elon Musk literally just flew into Cleveland this morning, where Cleveland-Cliffs is headquartered.","He never comes here, because why would anyone come to Cleveland (I live here; trust me, please stay away).

He's also gonna build us a new hyperloop, probably tunneled under Lake Erie, while he's here, just FYI. So when the U.S. descends into anarchy in the next several months, we'll be able to escape to Canada via underground tunnel.

wallstreetbets,The market is collapsing,"
###HOW YOU LIKE THEM APPLES B*TCHES
###CRASH COMIN BABY CHUUUUU CHUUUUUU






EDIT:
AS I SAID AT THE BOTTOM , I am NOT calling the top.
 

The US economy is fucked.
Housing is slowly collapsing, rent price are also slowly declining.
Goods and services are now extremely overpriced  even when accounting for inflation.

I am a truck driver, and let me tell you how I see things from the road.

Before the pandamic and this huge rise in costs, loads were paying about 3 dollars a mile when diesel was 2-3 dollars a gallon (even 1-2 dollars in some places)
During COVID, people were getting 4-5 dollars a miles per load, while diesel was still 2-3 dollars a gallon.

Now it's about 2-3 dollars per mile, and diesel is 4-7 dollars.


Solo drivers used to dominate the road.
Now, companies are specifically seeking team only operations (2 drivers in one truck) to order to  offset the cost of the fuel and also the decline/stagnation in pay rate from brokers/shippers.

In some places in the country, truckers are barely getting enough money from the loads to cover basic expenses. 

The market does what it wants , correct.
But the collapse is coming, and it WILL NOT  be a soft landing.


the Yellow Cab trucking company was the first big one to go under, and they were not the first and won't be the last.

Smaller companies and owner operators have been getting wiped off the map for almost 2 years now. The last 2 people I worked for had to close down shop.


What does that mean for you?

Trucking is the only way everyone in the country can have access to goods AND services that use any kind of tools or materials.
If we are losing money and work, it will soon translate into you and the companies you work for, going down the same path.

I believe real-estate,auto, entertainment, and all major stocks and the  underlying are headed to the ground in slow motion now and eventually at mach 10

wallstreetbets,You are not being ground into a fine powder by automation and AI.,"Sorry truck driver and other dude. The truth is each year our technology supplants our labor and increases productivity. 
In a humane and ethical society, as technology increases and reduces our labor burden, you'd expect increase in quality of life. Technology reducing the need for labor to maintain productive growth? This *should* look like reduced work hours and increased wages.

Instead we have a corporatocracy and a compliant (corrupt) government that slowly and surely deregulates everything and serves their corporate and wealthy interest groups (not labor). 

As technology increases and productivity booms with the increase of this efficiency generating tech the greedy overlords instead use this as an opportunity to *reduce labor costs*. Instead of maintaining healthy workforces, people are laid off to cut costs. Creating overworked laborers and fragile supply chains. 

Wages do not increase with inflation or productivity or GDP. Wages are stagnant. CoL increases across the board. Inflation strips people of their power. CoG prices skyrocket, but not because of inflation, but because of greed - compounding the blow to the average person. A double whammy of inflation devaluing their dollar and corporate greed driving up prices beyond what inflation would detract siphons the wealth out of the working and middle classes. 

This isn't anything new, we're all frogs in slowly boiling water, this has been happening for decades now but everyone has been too complacent to do anything about it - and a good portion of the country is blinded by propaganda designed to fracture the working class. 

You are slowly losing your rights. Slowly losing your buying power and being forced into a renter nation where the threat of homelessness being 1 paycheck away becomes more of a reality for more and more people. This is by design. This is to keep the status quo in power. Many people feel those jaws closing around them because their wages suck and buying power is reduced. Their workforce is stripped to the bare minimum, relying on overworked individuals and overleveraged machinery. 

We're not people to those at the top, we're a labor unit that is entirely disposable and they think it perfectly reasonable to use the threat of homelessness to keep us desperate and compliant. 

Nothing is collapsing, AI isn't taking over, we're experiencing a decades long capitalist design to strip our power and force more and more people into the position of wage slave.","['\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|25|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|12 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Technology is not to blame for the decline of the truck driver or the working class.

...I'm aware that had I held that last call for a little bit longer it could have been a substantially bigger gain but I have a certain risk tolerance and am treating this like true scalping (i.e. I have exit targets and I grab my profits on volatility- I rarely hold a position for more than 15 minutes and typically am in and out within 5.

VisualMod will undoubtedly say I am going to blow up my account one day but I am more careful than many of y'all might think...at the same time no I can't teach you to be a master scalper- it takes time, patience, a lot of combined technical charts, the right market climate (we're super choppy right now ahead of CPI making stocks go up and down and up and down which is better than straight up or straight down for scalping), fast hands, expensive support tools, and a lot of monitors.

wallstreetbets,Puts and Calls (actually) explained,"Saw a post earlier of someone explaining how puts and call options work, it was hilariously wrong. Here‚Äôs how they actually work. 

*Calls* 
If a stock is trading at $50 and you think it's going to go up to $60, you might buy a $55 ""call"" option for say, 20 cents. If the stock rose to $60, that would allow you to buy the stock at $55 (strike price) even though it's valued at $60, netting you a $4.80 profit on each share. On the other hand, the person that sold you the ""call"" would be obligated to sell you the stock at $55 at a loss of $4.80. If the stock never rises above $55 by expiration date, the
""call"" expires worthless and the ""call"" buyer is out 20 cents and the ""call"" seller keeps the 20 cents.

*Puts* 
If a stock is trading at $50 and you think it's going to go down to $40, you might buy a $45 ""put"" option for say, 20 cents. If the stock dropped to $40, that would allow you to sell the stock at $45 (strike price) even though it's valued at $40, netting you a $4.80 profit on each share. On the other hand, the person that sold you the ""put"" would be obligated to buy the stock from you at $45 at a loss of $4.80. If the stock never drops below $45 by expiration date, the ""put"" expires worthless and the ""put"" buyer is out 20 cents and the ""put"" seller keeps the 20 cents.

wallstreetbets,Easy Short for a possible 500% gain by next month,"**UPDATE - August 23rd:**

I sold all my positions today but the thesis hasn't changed. I made this post when $DWAC was at $17 that there's a good chance the vote will fail and the risk/reward then was way too good to pass up. The shares are now at $13.90 and I sold my positions because the risk/reward isn't worth it anymore in my opinion. You will now either make 100% on options if the vote fails or lose 100% if it passes. Gains:

**To anyone still in the position:** as of today (Aug 23rd) they STILL don't have enough votes. The CEO was going crazy over the weekend trying to tell everyone on Truth Social to go vote and even today he's getting super desperate. Here's the post today:

Based on this post it's **100% certain** if the vote was held today it would fail. They have less than 2 weeks left to get enough votes and Labor Day weekend is within these next few days. I honestly don't see it happening. Why did I sell? Because I made enough money with it and there's still a small chance it passes.  I don't gamble like that. My next move will be listening to the live meeting and making a play based on the outcome. Good luck everyone!

**Original Post:**

$DWAC has been trying to merge with Trump's company Truth Social for the past 2 years. The problem is the SEC has been investigating them making it impossible for them to merge. The SEC finally resolved the lawsuit so the stock jumped from $12 to $17 where it is now on that headline

So what's the problem? They haven't filed their S4 yet and don't plan to in October. However the SPAC will **EXPIRE** and **LIQUIDATE** on September 8th meaning as of right now on September 8th the SPAC will automatically go to $10.40. The ONLY way it can be saved by the MAGA people is if they vote to extend the SPAC for a year.

The problem with the vote is they need over 65% shareholder approval to pass the vote to save the SPAC. There was supposed to be a meeting today to tally the vote total, but the vote failed and they extended the meeting to September 5th. **IF THE VOTE DOESN'T PASS BY THE NEXT MEETING IT'S OVER FOR THEM.**

It's super hard to get 65% shareholder approval, especially when 90% of the people who own the stock are retail investors who don't even know they own it. Last year it took them over 4 months to pass this vote but this year they hardly have any time.

Positions: Right now $15 puts expiring September 15th are trading for $1.00 meaning they will be worth $5.00 when the SPAC liquidates. It is also an easy short now until the next meeting on September 5th

wallstreetbets,The job market is collapsing and you are a REGARD if you are bullish.,"FACT: The only thing that has kept the US from recession has been the strong employment picture. The latest jobs report showed the employment picture worsening.

My anecdotal experience: Things are getting BAD. I've been looking for a new job for a few months now and I was getting interviews left and right in june. Things started slowing down in July and recently everything has straight up collapsed in August. Job postings that used to have less than 100 applicants have more than 300. I do realize summer hiring it typically lower, but the current hiring right now seems to be the worst it's been in years. Something happened over the past month and I fully think the US economy is entering into the much discussed recession.

StockMarket,Nearly 94 percent of Warren Buffett's wealth was earned after he turned 60!,"Although Buffett was extremely successful before the age of 60 -- his net worth was a noted **$376 million** when he was 52 years old -- 99 percent of his wealth came after he turned 50. The perfect example of the powerful snowball effect over time. 

As time progresses, the exponential growth becomes more evident. The initial growth may seem slow, but as the investment horizon extends, the effect gathers momentum, significantly accelerating the growth of the investment. 

However, it's worth mentioning that Buffett's first $1,000,000 in 1960 is equivalent in purchasing power to about **$10,000,000 today**. So from today's purchasing power perspective, he actually became a millionaire in his twenties.

StockMarket,"Wealth researcher: ""You will hardly find anyone on the Forbes list who became rich investing in stocks."" Thoughts?","Wealth researcher Rainer Zitelmann: ""Yes, Warren Buffett is sometimes mentioned as an exception, but he is indeed an atypical investor in many ways and known for his active investment approach. Besides Buffett, you will find **very few individuals** on the Forbes list who haven't become wealthy through entrepreneurship and owning their own companies.

There is a dissertation that was conducted at the University of Potsdam, which scientifically examined how the wealthy achieved their wealth. The findings once again confirm that the majority of them have become rich as **entrepreneurs**. Indeed, 48 percent of respondents stated that real estate also played a significant role in wealth accumulation, but only 10 percent considered real estate as the most crucial factor in their wealth generation.

**Only 2.7 percent** of the surveyed wealthy individuals mentioned that stocks played a significant role in their wealth accumulation, making it a small minority among the respondents. I'm not discouraging investments in stocks; in fact, quite the opposite. I recommend everyone to consider a savings plan in a passive ETF. However, trying to get rich solely by investing in individual stocks can be challenging in the long term. While some may experience temporary success in a bull market or due to luck, I remain skeptical about its sustainability.

Last year, I gave a presentation to 250 ardent stock enthusiasts, and during the talk, I asked who among them had become wealthy through investing in stocks. With ""wealthy,"" I mean not less than one million. **Not a single person raised his hand**.

StockMarket,My Robinhood Journey,"I will make another reddit post on January 1st 2024 showing y'all where I'm at. Ill make y'all proud.

Not a financial advisor

Ive put a total of 65,219 since Sep 23 2019.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Current debt‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Car loan 12,000ish
Regular Loan 9,400 (for stocks that i lost a while ago)
Credit Card over 5,000(dumped most of it in stocks)
Total Debt. = 26,400ish

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Actual money‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
10,000 stocks 
1,200 bank

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîStrategy‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîIm nota financial adviser, you shouldnt do anything i say in this post. This is all fantasy and hypothetical entertainment.

Dont do this:
I always lose all my money when i buy a call on any stock.

Do this:
sell put credit spread. Why? Its very safe. You're making a bet that the stock doesn't go below a certain price. You pick a price thats very low so even if the stock goes down, it doesn't go down enouch to the price you picked and you keep the premium

Thats how i was even making money on spy while spy was going down

How i do it:
I pick the stock spy. Lets say spy is at 436. I sell the put credit spread at 429-428. It know this is hard to understand so go watch a video that explains put credit spread

CONTINUED: Its very unlikely that spy will drop that much. Spy can go to 434 or 430 but i doubt it would go down 8 dollars in 2 days to 429. Don't get me wrong it does happen BUTTT thats why i sell this contract AAAFFFFTTEERRRR it goes down. Maybe spy was at 440 and it went down to 436 and then i sell the put credit spread the same day, because no way in hell its bout to go down 12 dollars in 2 days. the price i picked (429). That would be a world record. Spy has options for everyday. I sell the put credit spreads for the VERY NEXT DAY. So i have 2 days (the day i bought it and the day it expires, for the stock to go up or down, it doesn't matter. It expires anyways and i keep the premium of lets say 600 and the money they held as collateral 10,000 so now after 2 days hypothetically, you go from 10,000 to 10,600. You make more money to more you risk, or you can play it safe and only make 200 out of every 10,000 dollars every 2 days


STRATEGIES TO PLAY IT SAFE:
1. Use half your money. If you have 10,000, you should use 5,000 one day and the 5,000 the other day in case the market crashes and goes to 0, you only lose half of your money. And all your money is still working for you 100% of the time

2. Pick different prices. Remember i picked
429-428? Well you can do 429-428 427-426 and 425-424. That way you're not making as much money but You're being way safer.

My Personal Game Plan

My credit card statement comes out in 2-3 weeks. Im gonna keep trading in robinhood for a little bit, then pull the money out and hopefully ill have 15,000 at least, then I'm gonna pay off my 9500 loan and 5,000ish credit card so it shows that its not maxed out on the statement and i still build credit this month. With my new beautiful credit score of 776 compared to 701 when i first got a 10,000 loan. Im gonna go to the bank and ask for 20,000. Then I'm gonna play it safe on robinhood and pay off the loan one day repeat.

In every instance but one, the U.S. economy went into recession within two years, and the median time to the onset of the recession was 16 months. ‚Ä¶ However, inversion of the yield curve has hardly been an accurate predictor of future market performance, as the S&P 500 was positive in the 12 months following inversion in 5 out of the 7 instances.

StockMarket,"""The dumbest reason in the world to buy a stock is because it's going up."" VS ""A trend has a higher probability of continuation than a reversal.""","* Warren Buffett often emphasizes the importance of investing with a long-term perspective and a focus on fundamental value. When he made the statement, ""**The dumbest reason in the world to buy a stock is because it's going up**,"" he was highlighting a common mistake that many inexperienced investors make: chasing short-term price movements without considering the underlying fundamentals of the company.

&#x200B;

* Mark Minervini on the other hand tweeted the statement **""A trend has a higher probability of continuation than a reversal""** reflecting his belief in the principles of momentum and trend-following trading strategies. Minervini believes that timing your trades is critical and recommends you to combine technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management.

&#x200B;

* Warren Buffett by contrast believes trying to time the market is a waste of time and hazardous to investment success. As far as technical analysis is concerned, he once said  ""**I realized that technical analysis didn't work when I turned the chart upside down and didn't get a different answer.**""¬†

&#x200B;

* Jesse Livermore gave the advice to never buy at the bottom, and always sell too soon.

&#x200B;

* Buffett however once said, ""**Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful**"".

&#x200B;

* Livermore was a strong advocate of stop-loss orders and would always have them in place to minimize potential losses.

&#x200B;

* Buffett in contrast joked that ‚Äúusing a stop loss has always struck me as like having a house that you like, and you‚Äôre living in, and it‚Äôs worth $100,000 and you tell your broker, ‚ÄòYou know, if anybody ever comes along and offers $90 \[thousand\], you want to sell it.""

StockMarket,Is AAPL still a good long term investment? Poke holes in my strategy,"Much has been said about AAPL over the last few days and some people are starting to wonder if Apple stock is still an ironclad bet as their revenue fell year over year for the third consecutive quarter.

Reasons why I'm still very bullish on AAPL:

* Apple services increased by 8% year on year, setting a new all-time high for the third consecutive quarter.
* At a macro level we're seeing greater smartphone penetration in emerging markters (BRICS, African LION economies, etc.) which will continue to benefit Apple.
* Customer LTV continues to grow in tandem with ancillary services and products.
* The App Store is still the main destination for app builders and as an indirect result, billions of dollar are poured annually by LP's and VCs in the ecosystem.
* The VR/AR revolution will be captured by Apple (Have you tried Microsoft Hololenses?? Yup not so great).
* Still has one of the best econometric profiles across public market co's.

&#x200B;

**My AAPL Investment strategy: Feel free to poke holes**  


https://preview.redd.it/a16kykyhz1ib1.png?width=3201&format=png&auto=webp&s=21874bedcc7776847a3ab17ad2cdf9a5fb791c12

If there's strong momentum in SPY, I stay in AAPL, otherwise I look at the tech market more generally, and if it's oversold, I invest more broadly in QQQ, or go into other assets such as short term bonds. Essentially trying to manage risk if AAPL is overvalued and it drops significantly.  


  
Are you guys still bullish on AAPL.","['Yes! Apple is like cola, it will never go away again. The brand and brand recognition is huge!', 'Good investments are more about price and timing than the business itself. That said from a DCA and longevity view. Apple are still set to be a big dog in 10 years.', ""Just wait until they introduce the iRobot.\n\nI think there's a Will Smith movie about it."", 'Solid strategy. Does anyone know what tool OP is using?', 'You don‚Äôt trade Apple. You own it.', ""The services side is why I'm bullish. The ecosystem as well, once people are hooked onto apple products, they really can't get away from it."", 'Not saying Apple will be a bad investment but to poke holes in it:\n\n1. You leave valuation complete out of it - great company is one thing but you can overpay for a great company. I would have NVDA, SHOP, TTD etc if they would have a market multiple.\n\n2. AR/VR waaay to soon to call anything. Going by that logic one should own Yahoo, AOL etc. \n\n3. You don‚Äôt just win by throwing money at something. Sure having the money increases your chances but so many examples of how that does not work. \n\n4. You have to take into account things like upgrade cycles and how fast technology changes. IPhone 4 to 6 imo made more impact and thus there is more willingness to upgrade. If cycles prolong by one year makes a big impact.\n\n5. Regulatory risks. The largest companies have some practices that will likely face more regulatory headwind the share Apple takes in the AppStore for subscriptions is i.e. one of the things that might continue indefinitely but might as well be way more regulated within a couple of years. Same goes with right to repair etc.\n\n6. I don‚Äôt know if you are from the US but IPhones Position is way different in Europe/Asia could be a bonus as there is more potential for IPhone penetration, but just going by smartphone penetration does not really mean anything to the contrary people will not start buying IPhones you would rather profit from people moving up to the middle class etc.\n\n7. Now this is not supposed to be unkind, but there is not a lot of thesis to poke holes into. Your points are valid to varying degrees but that does not make a thesis up in my mind. Do you have an opinion on ASPs and why that would behave that way also on overall Units sold for the IPhone as their biggest product and what type of product would move the needle so everything that is not included.\n\n8. Diversification is extremely powerful in investing I don‚Äôt really see a good argument for having high concentration in any single stock as returns turn geometric and your pick would have to outperform massively to beat the simple math of justification and outperform on a risk adjusted basis.\n\nThose would be just some aspects. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I like Apple, I like the brand, the valuation is not crazy but I is just like buying any other large quality business at an OK price have not seen any reason why AAPL in particular would be a great investment and the reasoning is not really\nconvincing to me at least at all. \n\nHope despite the somewhat negative framing you can find some value in that.', 'India is going to be huge for apple.', 'AAPL as a tech stock is OK to accumulate. If it was more a phone company, then it would be overvalued.  Even it does not sell phones by selling services will fed millions of people who worked on it. QQQ is a more diversified etf. It is actually 10% less volatile than AAPL which is relatively risker.', 'Services is the golden goose.

Our world is very connected nowadays, so easing in Japan causes easing in the US, and tightening in Japan could sting our markets.

StockMarket,Dr Reddy's Posts Bullish Q1 Results (NYSE: RDY)(NSE: DRREDDY),"Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (NYSE: RDY, NSE: DRREDDY) is a globally renowned pharma player based in India but operating globally. Dr. Reddy's serves major markets such as the USA, India, Russia & CIS countries, China, Brazil, and Europe. While the company has recently expanded into the Indian trade generics industry through RGenX, its broader focus lies in positioning itself for further success by capitalizing on the thriving Indian pharmaceuticals sector and exploring avenues for innovation, digital healthcare, biologics, gene therapy, and nutrition-focused initiatives. This dual-strategy approach, known as Horizon 1 and Horizon 2, allows Dr. Reddy's Laboratories to remain at the forefront of the pharmaceutical landscape, delivering value to both patients and investors.

This biotech/pharma powerhouse has so far witnessed a highly bullish 2023, with share price for its US ticker up +33% YTD, thereby surpassing average analyst price targets and defying expectations. The most recent jump of \~10-15% over the course of the past week is linked to the release of its FY24 Q1 financials, which follow up a stellar FY23 annual report that showed robust growth and expansion across its numerous business segments. Lets take a look at last week's results and why they are causing such a stir with RDY/DRREDDY shareholders:

* Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (NYSE: RDY, NSE: DRREDDY) reported strong financial performance in Q1 FY24, with a 36% YoY revenue growth in Global Generics (GG) segment, driven by North America, Emerging Markets, and Europe.
* North America revenue surged by 79% YoY in Q1 FY24, mainly due to new product launches and continued momentum in existing products. The company filed four new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the USFDA and commercialized the acquired generic prescription portfolio.
* Despite a challenging environment, Europe and Emerging Markets also witnessed revenue growth of 22% and 28% YoY, respectively, attributed to base business momentum, new product launches, and favorable forex rates.
* The company's gross margin improved by \~880 bps YoY to 58.7% in Q1 FY24, driven by a favorable product mix and higher manufacturing leverage.
* Dr. Reddy's continued its focus on research and development (R&D) to build a robust pipeline of new products, with R&D expenses accounting for 7.4% of revenues in Q1 FY24.
* Profit before Tax grew by 26% YoY in Q1 FY24, showcasing the company's ability to navigate market dynamics effectively.
* The company maintains a strong financial position with a net cash surplus of Rs. 49.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, enabling it to invest in growth opportunities and potential acquisitions.

My biggest takeaways from this strong Q1 showing is that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories demonstrated better-than-expected revenue growth and EPS in Q1 FY24, driven by strong performance in North America, Emerging Markets, and Europe, indicating the company's ability to capitalize on market opportunities. This translates into a very solid bottom line that makes this a defensive fundamental play for investors. Furthermore, the focus on R&D and continuous efforts to build a healthy pipeline of new products position Dr. Reddy's well for future growth, making it an attractive prospect for investors looking for a pharmaceutical company with a solid growth strategy and the potential for pleasant surprises down the road.

If hiking interest rate to 5.5% this rapidly (steepest in history) and it's not slowing down inflation drastically, could inflation be due to something else?

Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, Leading Them to Encourage Others to Buy for their own profits?","NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock‚Äôs potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts‚Äô sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment.

In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA‚Äôs momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow.

Bullish right? Not so fast. Most people don't seem to understand why the fed lowers rates let alone why they raise them. The only time the fed will consider lowering rates is when disaster has hit and demand has halted. The fed doesn't lower rates to stimulate the economy for no reason. Otherwise, if they did and disaster hit after, the means to stimulate the economy dramatically lessen. Furthermore, even though CPI has gone down a lot, have noticed that the fed is still raising rates? How about prices going up still despite CPI going down? Ya, that's because the measure used by the fed is PCE which remains stubbornly high. These institutions and exceedingly clever in getting people to buy rather than sell because they benefit from this, especially when one of these variables ignites and it's time to sell.\n\nBottom line is this:\n\nI'm not saying that you should sell, I just strongly caution any of you approaching the market with a bullish lens only."", ""Where'd you find this?"", 'Rude awakening in future?', 'How can I find this?

What's important now is that if we close below $190 for APPLE this week...it will be (2 consecutive) weeks starting of negative returns. That's a highly correlated sign to negative returns going forward.

If it's flips to negative...is it time to sell?

StockMarket,Am I supposed to be making money?,"Hi, 
Just a quick question.
I started investing in april 2021, probably near the first peak after the covid crash. 
I understand that I bought at crazy valuations. I invested a small lump sum and added 1k a month pretty consistently, buying a mix of stocks and etf, mainly dividend paying.
After 2 and a half years my portfolio is in the green by 1% and I don't know what to think of it because I have no reference to judge this result. 
I was under the impression that I could make an aversge of 5-8% a year.

StockMarket,The Buffett Indicator Model signals an overvalued stock market. Worrisome?,"The Buffett Indicator (aka, Buffett Index, or Buffett Ratio) is the ratio of the total United States stock market to GDP. As of July 31, 2023 the ratio is calculated as:

*Aggregate US Market Value: $48.97T* 

*divided by*

*Annualized GDP: $26.91T*

***= 182%***

The current ratio of 182% is approximately 51.35% (or about 1.7 standard deviations) above the historical trend line, suggesting that the stock market is Overvalued relative to GDP.

The last times the ratio was like this were in September 2000, August 2020 and April 2022. The question is whether the Buffett Indicator should really be seen as a warning signal or not, given the fact that the modern economy has seen a rise in technology companies and businesses with significant intangible assets, such as patents and intellectual property and these assets may not be adequately represented in the GDP, potentially skewing the results of the Buffett Indicator.

StockMarket,$HRYU is looking undervalued and primed for LT growth after recent IPO,"Anyone else a fan of K-Pop? Regardless if the answer is yes or no, Hanryu Holdings (NASDAQ: HRYU) is a fresh listee in the world of k-culture as of August 1st and is looking severely undervalued following a post-IPO dip. Here's the play I'm seeing:

In a nutshell, HRYU manages a social media platform called Fantoo that is a one-stop shop for all things k-pop. Just recently, on August 9th, the company launched the 2.0 version of the platform that already enjoys a user base of >26M spread across some 150 countries. These guys have a fast-expanding global footprint, and are primed for sustained growth moving forward. 

https://preview.redd.it/q9l0btldx9jb1.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=3aa1d5997185c733904d26dd944c6efa12ce766b

The company went public at an initial share price of $10 and, after three weeks of high-volume trading, rounded off last week at $5.07. I for one am interpreting this drop as an attractive entry point to establish a position in a company that has serious potential to become THE global k-pop powerhouse. Here are some of the reasons why I‚Äôm LT bullish on this k-pop tech play and think now is prime time to get in early:

**-Massive TAM.**  For the uninitiated, K-pop is one of the trendiest global phenomena after FIFA. According to independent market research groups, as of 2020 the purchasing power of the global k-culture market was a whopping $124B, whereas the global virtual event market industry was valued at $94B in 2020, with a robust 24% CAGR forecast through 2028. HRYU just happens to overlap with both of these booming industries.

As I mentioned above, Fantoo already has 26M users and witnessed 3500% growth in its user base over the past 12 months. Given the platform has only been live for about two years and the 2.0 version for a mere two weeks, the growth potential of Fantoo is massive. Looking at these figures, it really looks like it's only upwards from here in terms of user acquisition. 

https://preview.redd.it/7jo4jqdhx9jb1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=0efaf39438e40faaa59a6543827fbee8085945da

**-Bullish analyst forecasts.** Notwithstanding HRYU‚Äôs dip to under $4 over its first 9 days on NASDAQ, the announcement that it had released version 2.0 of Fantoo catalyzed a clear rebound. In the week and half since, share price has begun stabilizing around $5, though price action performance has been marked by volatility‚Äìas expected‚Äìin the immediate aftermath of the IPO. 

Despite the post-IPO volatility, Baptista Research has issued a $12 PT for HRYU which represents >100% from current share price for 2023. On the basis of a DFC methodology, Baptista projects: ‚ÄúOur target price at the end of 2024 is $19.9 and for 2025 is $26.8 which implies a total appreciation of nearly 278.7% in the coming 3 years in the stock price.‚Äù Given these forecasts, $5 is a pretty sexy entry point for investors willing to shoulder some risk. 

https://preview.redd.it/lxoynj0rx9jb1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=4852cbe58cfb7ec190c4bffedb6d7f7a6d0e4d28

Putting together these two rationales, the TAM for the booming k-culture industry translates into triple-digit upside for HRYU through 2023 and beyond. The fact that HRYU is trading at around 50% its initial offering price of $10 presents a window of opportunity to get in early for a long-term hold play. Macro-global market trends and exceedingly bullish analyst ratings both strongly indicate that HRYU is trading well below fair value and is geared for a roaring recovery moving forward.

StockMarket,"Minervini: ‚ÄûDuring my 40 years trading none of my success came from picking a bottom right at the low. The low happens on one day, the bull market last for years. The big money is made spotting trends not bottoms.‚Äú Thoughts?","Isn‚Äòt this statement problematic since trend trading relies on short-term price movements and market speculation, rather than focusing on the fundamental value of a company?

Buffett famously said to be be greedy when others are fearful. Minervini, however, claims that contrarian investing, where investors go against the prevailing sentiment in the hope of capitalizing on market overreaction is useless.

But isn‚Äôt the challenge with trend trading that by the time a trend becomes apparent, the price may have already risen significantly? So, it‚Äôs basically riskier to enter the trade, as there's a possibility that the trend might reverse?

You have to figure out how to make money being right only 20 to 30 percent of the time."" \\~ Bill Lipschutz', 'A trend that last for years is not really short term price movements. It core trading, you apply the principles of technical trading to long term holdings.\n\nThe valuation of a company is much harder to assertain than seeing a trendline break on a chart. Plus since the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Even if you were to be correct on the low valuation of a company and also be right on the correct price the stock should be. You might still not make bank.\n\nI was getting burned by my swing trading recently, despite the great profit, it\'s a lot of work, then accounting, etc. So I was interested in starting value investing. To have a long term holding place to put my recent gains to compound them for later.\nI read multiple books on value investing, they talk extensively about EPS, net revenue, assets, debt, how to read a financial report, etc.\n\nWhat became apparent reading ""Margin of safety: risk-averse value investing strategies for the thoughtful investor"" by Seth A Klarman (a book that W. Buffet has in his office and supposedly purchased a copy for 13k$ claiming it was worth every penny). Is that all those EPS, EBIT, EBITDA, dept, revenue, etc are all horseshit. They work the same way technical indicators do. For a while people only cared about EPS, then someone invents a new ratio and claims its so much better than the other and anyone not using it is missing out. So people start using it, meaning that everyone buys the same stocks (the one that have a good score under that new ratio) which then becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Just like technical indicators when everyone started using bollinger bands in 2010-15,... \n\nThat was the first book to mention this. Which I thought was very accurate and logical. I highly recommend the book. But then the author goes on how these indicators aren\'t really great, and none show you the companies that are really undervalued. He goes on to explain how to work that out without those well known and biased ratios, but then warns that even if really undervalued it might still not start to climb just because you bought it. That actually the best is to find a value that has assets - debts that are much higher than it\'s valuation, then purchase the company and liquidate all of its assets (which is something Buffet did do in the past, but sadly requires to already have enough to purchase an entire company, which I don\'t).\n\nTL;DR: It became clear after reading this book, which is probably one of the best on value investing, that value investing is no better than throwing chicken bones in the air, and requires a good deal of luck even when you correctly identified a massively undervalued company. \n\nYou might be stuck in a position for years without making much profit. After years of not doing much you might start to think you\'re money would be better off in AAPL or SPY, but you can\'t sell because nobody wants that crapy company you bought so you\'re stuck on an illiquid position. If you\'re unlucky you\'ll sell after 5 years for a meager 10% gain, and then see the stock do +200% 2 months later, turns out you were right, too sad you just sold. Even if you did stay in long enough to see it boom, when do you sell? When you made a 100%? What if it goes to +500% next? What if you wait for +500 but ut it never comes, went to +201% then dropped all the way back down to +20 before you got time to sell because those are long term holdings, you\'re not watching them every day and it just so happen to have pumped and dumped in the 2 weeks per year where you\'re on holiday on the other side of the world with poor internet?\n\nAll in all I prefer trading. I have a known batting average on my technical pattern, and despite being under 50% win rate, with proper money management I still turn it into a 30-40% profit per year before tax, sadly my country has a per transaction tax (i\'m also taxed on loosing trades) so in the end I\'m left with 12-15% when I don\'t get stopped out too much (same strategy in another country would be much more profitable).

StockMarket,How to Get Rich and Famous From a Stock Market Crash,,"['HEARD ON THE STREET\n\nHow to Get Rich and Famous From a Stock Market Crash\n\n‚ÄúBig Short‚Äù hero Michael Burry sees disaster and‚Äîeventually‚Äîhe‚Äôll get it right again.\n\nBy Spencer Jakab\n\n‚ÄúSooner or later a crash is coming, and it could be terrific.‚Äù\n\nA wimpy prediction like that would struggle to go viral in 2023. It caused a sensation in 1929, though, weeks before Black Tuesday. In a preview of that calamity, stocks briefly plunged in what would be called the Babson Break.\n\nAmerica was about to sink into the Great Depression, but newsletter writer Roger Babson would reap fame and fortune from his timely call, founding a college and even running for president. Few remember that he also predicted trouble in 1927 and 1928, and later on made a premature recovery call.\n\nEvery market crash or bottom has a Babson‚Äîsomeone who can dine out forever by nailing it. In 1987, it was Elaine Garzarelli, who predicted a collapse days before Black Monday. She became the best-paid strategist on Wall Street for a while and went on to run some poorly performing mutual funds. In 1982, it was Elliott Wave theorist Robert Prechter‚Äôs predicting a roaring bull market after stocks spent 16 years in the doldrums, but also crashes that never materialized. Both are still making money in the punditry business despite decades of mostly lousy predictions.\n\n(In response to emailed questions, Garzarelli says that claims on her website of ‚Äú94.5% correct calls‚Äù have been audited, while Prechter was more humble, admitting that criticisms of his record are ‚Äúabout right‚Äù).\n\nMichael Burry is the latest seer with a shaky encore. His early but successful bet on the 2007-08 housing bust made him rich and‚Äî after Christian Bale played him in the Hollywood adaptation of Michael Lewis‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Big Short‚Äù- famous. \n\nBut he has also made at least five dire predictions about stocks in just the past four years with comments such as ‚Äúcould be worse than 2008‚Äù and ‚Äúgreatest speculative bubble of all time.‚Äù\n\nBuying the S&P 500 instead would have made an investor money each time in the six months after his views became public. The average annualized gain was 34%‚Äîabout four times the index‚Äôs long-run appreciation. His latest public warning was a one-word tweet this January from a frequently deleted account called Cassandra BC: ‚ÄúSELL.‚Äù\n\nThat one didn‚Äôt work out either, but Burry‚Äôs investment firm, Scion Asset Management, still gets outsize attention. There have been 264 print-media mentions of Burry in the past month alone, according to Factiva, spurred by Scion‚Äôs latest securities filings. It purchased puts ‚Äîbets on a market decline‚Äîon two popular stock index funds. \n\nTo the uninitiated, the notional value of the derivatives makes it look as though he bet nearly everything on a crash. That isn‚Äôt the case at all, but Burry has done nothing to disabuse his 1.4 million followers on X (formerly known as Twitter) of that idea.\n\nBurry, who didn‚Äôt respond to requests to comment, might fancy himself a Cassandra, but he is the polar opposite. The Trojan priestess was cursed with always being right but never being believed. \n\nIt isn‚Äôt hard to understand why prophets of doom get so much public attention, but how does one explain famous ones being so unimpressive after they become famous?\n\nNumerous studies of expert opinion have shown that pundits are, as a group, as accurate as a coin flip. Some have a special knack for being wrong, though. In an analysis of 68 stock market gurus several years ago, CXO Advisory Group had Prechter as dead last. The explanation is simple, according to ‚ÄúPredicting the Next Big Thing,‚Äù a 2010 study by Jerker Denrell and Christina Fang. People who got rich and famous on extreme bets tend to follow up with more of them, and outlier predictions typically fail.\n\nThe saying, though, is that ‚Äúa broken clock is right twice a day,‚Äù not once. Burry is certainly eccentric, but probably less-so than Babson, who tried to reinstate Prohibition and invent an antigravity device. And, unlike most pundits, he put his money where his mouth was on his big housing call and many successful stock picks.\n\nTalk remains cheap. If you aspire to become the next Babson, Prechter or Garzarelli, this might even be an ideal time to make a call on social media and timestamp it: Rising interest rates and historically high stock valuations provided the backdrop to wipeouts in 1929, 1973, 1987 and 2007. Unfortunately, the cacophony of online voices means that, on any given day, there is someone out there also predicting a calamity.\nUnless you are saying it on CNBC or have Goldman Sachs on your business card, the chances of being sought for your views are far higher if you actually risk money‚Äîideally other people‚Äôs, not your own. And if your timing is impeccable, the hardest part is over‚Äîyou will be rich. Now just get Michael Lewis to write a book about you.', 'Even a broken clock is right twice a day.', 'I had to watch The Big Short twice to understand 10% of what they were saying', 'Last paragraph golden üí∞', 'You gotta pay to read that article', 'It‚Äôs not about whether he‚Äôs right or wrong. He had balls to hold lots of money on the line which none of us could.', 'Remind me! 3 months ‚Äúread this again‚Äù', 'I would say he‚Äôs being realistic. Bulls think the market goes up no matter the economic conditions. It‚Äôs called greed. At a certain point reality sets in.', 'Well that‚Äôs fine but people need/want someone to listen to. He got it right once, and it wasn‚Äôt by accident. Who else has got it right to that extent? He actually got it right twice with GameStop. Although that was clearly more manufactured. I don‚Äôt think think too many people are buying or selling based on anything he‚Äôs saying.', 'This article is absolute drivel. Clearly doesn‚Äôt know much about the lead up to the 1929 or 1987 crashes, who Babson was, how many people mocked him and called for ever higher prices and were right for a long time before looking foolish and then cleverly hedges his article at the very end so if we do get a bear market he can say well I didn‚Äôt say it was never going to happen!\n\nIf he knew wtf he was talking about he would know that every major bear market/crash in modern history has been kicked off by a seemingly innocuous catalyst that people largely waved off as insignificant. We just had one a few weeks ago with the Fitch US debt downgrade! Fear takes time to take hold, it doesn‚Äôt show up on day one.\n\nI personally agree with Burry on this one and think the amount of ridicule this particular trade is getting is noteworthy. Right now it is virtually consensus that stocks will go up forever at a time of unprecedented debt, extreme valuations, a not particularly great job market and slowing GDP.']"
StockMarket,The Best Lithium Stocks List I've Come Across,"Especially like being able to filter by project details such as the phase of the project, the project's country and type of lithium resource (brine, rock, clay, etc.). 

Link: [https://greenstocksresearch.com/lithium-stocks/](https://greenstocksresearch.com/lithium-stocks/)

The asset descriptions are also quite useful. When I try to research lithium stocks so much of the content seems to be promoting the smallest junior mining companies. I am looking to invest in companies that are already producing lithium to reduce risk and hopefully ride the EV growth.

Currently long Pilbara, Albemarle and Lithium Americas. Would be interested in suggestions of other producing or near producing companies.

Some risks with SQM being in Chile though so would recommend to DYOr', 'I think biggest risks if you\'re going for miners that are already producing and not needing to prospect as much, would be political climate and proximity to recurring natural disaster areas (i.e. volcanos, earthquakes, hurricanes, costal flooding, etc).\n\nChile for instance has a high potential for political issues with the natural resource perhaps going the way of Venezuela and oil wells. So if that is the risk, know how much of a lead weight it is on the potential companies with exposure. IIRC Albermarle has the largest Lithium Salt Flat in Chile, so as a potential risk that could have a heavy impact if say Lithium production and refinement is nationalized. Also it being a costal nation on a large fault line as well as a region that has potential high risk to erosion, those factors could influence overall viability of production.\n\nThat being said I think Albermarle is probably the premium name in the space for Lithium, so if that\'s the target I think that Albermarle is the standard benchmark for other companies.\n\nA lot of the other players in Chile (not all, but most of the smaller miners) have a significant presence of Chinese investment hidden through shell corporations, so be careful and investigate companies as some are intentionally cooking the books within ""reasonable tollerance"" for Chinese ran companies.\n\nAnother alternative would be PLL, and then I think there\'s another one that\'s US based down south...forgot the ticker.', ""No Premier African Minerals (LSE:PREM) ?????????\n\n\nIt's more than a stock.

StockMarket,I need a little advice to change my broker,"Hello, I just want to know what people think of this situation I am facing right now. Nothing too important but I want to know.

I am not a professional trader or nothing, I started investing for fun and I like to grow slow and learn because it is not my main job.

I started with only $500 in the platform and right now I am almost at +80% up since i began 2 years ago. But now they emailed me that they will charge me $10 for innactivity for each month? They already charge me and now my balance is -$10 negative
They also charge me $5 for each order, for buy and sell so that is another $10 for each transaction (in total I have paid from this fees almost $90) If it wasn't for all the fees they charge I could be more than double up in my little porfolio.

Is like they are pushing to daytrade instead of invest. What is this?

This innactivity fee is normal across all platforms? If not, which broker do people recomend? so I can transfer from Tradestation to another broker that does not charge these fees

StockMarket,"Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole: What about this week:","In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week. 

August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021.

Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the ""job is done,"" lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is ""well above"" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July. Nvidia's earnings release in late May signaled a shift in overall market mood for the year, with Wall Street strategists becoming more overtly bullish on stock market performance in 2023. ","[""For NVIDIA, the release of its financial data will further influence the market's expectations for the demand in the field of artificial intelligence. The upward revision of the company's forecast numbers indicates the potential of this industry. However, the article also mentions the possible impact of overall market trends on NVIDIA's stock performance."", ""I still can't put my head around Nvidia's forecast. This is too much expectation and speculation and FRANKLY, I've never seen or heard of any company that does not have exclusivity skyrocketed this much. It didn't come out with a new patent that could be exclusive for the next ten years!  Some of the best in the semi conductor business didn't impress. NVIDIA will be the same. SELL NVIDIA,  SELL NVIDIA!"", 'well it popped today', 'Cuda is a monopoly. A big, sticky moat. They‚Äôve been engaging developers practically in the womb for a generation. Now the best chips are literally many times worth their weight in gold. They literally can charge whatever they want.', 'And what if it doesn‚Äôt pop on earnings day? The biggest diarrhea you‚Äôve ever seen.', 'Yeah, Nvidia will print money there next five years.. maybe then they get competitors... Until then: brrrr', 'The market changes are too significant, please catch it when it takes off', 'I already hold it. Had to decrease due to its volatility.']"
StockMarket,There is a major disconnect between Wall Street investors/market makers and the Fed when it comes to the future of interest rates.,"They just issued the inflation report for July. It went up to 3.2%. It was 3% last month. This is the first month since June of 2022 that inflation increased month over month. With this information I literally see articles already brewing stating that investors are cheering and consider this good news. Based on the fact that it was lower than expectations. And then proceed to explain how there is very little chance that the FED will increase rates again.

Now to my point. It seriously scares me how much of a disconnect there is between these big investors/market makers and the FEDs ultimate rate hike decisions. This has literally happened 3 or 4 times in the last year where Wall Street articles tell me that key investors and market makers are convinced that the FED WILL stop raising interest rates and will begin cutting very soon. And how many times were they right? Pretty much none. The FED has proven again and again and again that they don‚Äôt give a damn what these Wall Street investors believe. They have their own plan in place and will continue raising interest rates at their own discretion, based on data and forecasts they think are realistic and not the reality that Wall Street is trying to manifest.

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is that I have seen this happen numerous times in the last year where financial articles keep telling us that Wall Street believes the FED WILL stop rate hikes and lower interest rates soon. And every time they‚Äôre wrong. And today I saw another article based on the inflation report basically stating the same thing I‚Äôve said multiple times in this article. I‚Äôm really starting to distrust wall streets predictions on what the FED has planned. Like the FED has stated they will probably raise rates again one more time. So I‚Äôm going to believe them given the fact that they have gone against Wall Street predictions numerous times.

Ultimately, this makes me start questioning Wall Street investors and market makers forecasts and predictions on a broader scale for the financial markets. And eventually some time next year, when they start convincing us that the FED WILL lower interest rates at the following fed meeting, I will be inclined to go against their predictions, based on their history of failed predictions. And I‚Äôm inclined to believe that the FED will probably not lower interest rates anytime soon.

This post was not meant to state whether or not the FED SHOULD be raising interest rates. This is simply to identify the disconnect between big investors/market makers and the FEDs stated plan involving interest rates and inflation.

This is something I‚Äôve been bottling up for almost a year now and needed to vent.

Thank you

Edit: Sorry I might not have communicated my ultimate concern as well as I would have liked. I'm not arguing whether or not the Fed SHOULD raise rates, I'm simply focused on the fact that they have stated they will more then likely raise rates one more time. This was at their last Fed meeting. And based on an inflation report that was released today, a lot of ""experts"" claim there is a very low probability that they will raise rates again. And I think past performance from fed meetings shows a lot of stability that they will raise rates one more time. To put it simply, I'm seeing a lot of news that they won't raise rates one more time even know I'm confident they will raise them one more time. And how this makes me distrust a lot of experts opinions from upper tier financial articles moving forward.","['For what it is worth, the Fed also has no idea if they are going to raise rates.

StockMarket,AMZN Q2 2023 Earnings Report," 

\*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*

1. Operating Activities:

The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.

2. Investing Activities:

Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.

3. Financing Activities:

The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.

4. Cash Position:

Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.

5. Debt and Interest Payments:

The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.

6. Net Sales:

Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.

7. Operating Expenses:

Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.

8. Operating Income:

Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.

9. Non-Operating Expense:

The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.

10. Net Income (Loss):

Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.

11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):

Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.

12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):

PROs & CONs:

Pros:

‚Ä¢ Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.

‚Ä¢ Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.

‚Ä¢ Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.

‚Ä¢ Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.

‚Ä¢ Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.

‚Ä¢ Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.

‚Ä¢ Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.

‚Ä¢ Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.

‚Ä¢ Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.

‚Ä¢ Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.

‚Ä¢ Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.

TLDR;

Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments.

July 2023: the S&P 500 trades at 25x trailing P/E

The trailing P/E (Price-to-Earnings) ratio of the S&P 500 represents the ratio of the index's current stock price to its earnings per share (EPS) over the past 12 months. **A trailing P/E ratio of 25 for the S&P 500 is generally considered to be in the mid-range in terms of valuation.** It's neither extremely high nor unusually low.

On the other hand, the S&P 500 10-year P/E ratio, also known as the Shiller P/E or CAPE (Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings) ratio, takes an average of inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. This smoothes out short-term fluctuations and provides a longer-term perspective on market valuation. **The current S&P500 10-year P/E Ratio is 31.4**. This is 55.7% above the modern-era market average of 20.2, putting the current P/E 1.4 standard deviations above the modern-era average.

Graham generally favored stocks with a low PE ratio, particularly those below the average PE ratio of the market. He believed that stocks with a low PE ratio were often undervalued and offered better investment opportunities.

Mark Minervini, stock trader known for his ""SEPA"" (Specific Entry Point Analysis) method, however, challenges Graham's principles: ""PE just shows expectation.

StockMarket,Inflation question -- Who/what is driving up demand?,"When we first started raising rates, I could get behind why the consumer (then) was likely behind rising inflation.

However, fast forward to today with rates where they are at, I'm not sure I still believe it's the consumer driving up demand. Not only is your average consumer making significantly less then they did last year, but for many, affording some of the most basic shit is now a struggle. I refuse to believe it's the money received for COVID either. Not only was that TWO years ago, but for many of us, that money was gone within a month.

So, I'm curious, *who exactly is behind demands' increase?*

* Which sector, corporation or group of people are consuming and demanding loads of money to the extent we're seeing today?
* Is it really just consumers spending recklessly?
* Or is there another element to this that many people don't know?

I don't want to completely dismiss the consumer's role in all of this, but the more I think about all this, the more I start to think it's something else. If anything, possibly the government itself and its ability to [pay off debt by printing money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15qe45u/us_economics_101/). That and or large corporations unaffected by rates where they are at.

*When I look at the governments insane interest payment due as a result of its debt, I can't help but wonder how much the federal government behind inflation itself.* If the federal government can pay off its debt by printing money--money that subsequently increases supply and in turn lowers the value of the dollar--how much of inflation is impacted by the government's printer?

That and reckless spending by the government as well?

# TLDR

Not sure if consumer demand is the sole reason behind inflation. How likely is it for the government to be behind inflations presence today? Especially when they can print money to pay debt off.","['Every year, corporations need to make more profit than the year before.', ""I still think consumer demand is very high. There seems to be no shortage of people willing to watch Barbie or Oppenheimer. Chick fil a lines are still wrapped around the parking lots and spilling out into the street. Can't find any used cars under 15k and my Toyota Dealership only had 2 camry's on the lot. Walking around it seems like everyone still has money (or pretends to)."", ""Demand-pull is not the only type of inflation. There is also cost-push inflation, where prices soar because of rising costs. It may be due to an ongoing war, a shortage of raw materials (like, let's say, electronic chips). Maybe that has also worsened the situation. I know nothing about inflation, but I guess printing billions of dollars worth in war supplies did not help as well..."", 'This inflation period is largely supply driven from supply shocks coupled with dilution of currency from money printing. There is definitely a global post pandemic recovery boom that‚Äôs pulling demand for necessary goods eg. Oil, but consumers in general aren‚Äôt the ones to blame as they are trying to hold on to what they can to fight it while inflation is eating away the less privileged ones.', 'This is my understanding of why. \n\n 1 governments hands out money to people that don‚Äôt know what to do with it. This created a spending spree. Lower interest rates created refining boom and more people with money that don‚Äôt know anything but to spend. Homes skyrocketed due to interest rates pushing up the home value on the refinancing of homes. \n\n2 People were not working and making more money then when they did. When it was time to work they felt like they couldn‚Äôt work for less then there hand out from the government in fact they want more. \n\n3 The cost of homes went high because people could afford them with low interest rates. This caused the rents to go up. There‚Äôs a rule in rentals 1% so a house valued at $250,000 rents for $2,500 a month. I‚Äôm a landlord this is how I do it too. \n\n4 because people will not work for the same wages as before Covid and the hand out wages have gone up to stay in business and are past on to consumers. \n\nSo here‚Äôs what‚Äôs not happening. Rents are not going back down much or at all. Wages are not going back down either. Which means cost of goods and services will not go back down either. Homes can‚Äôt go down much because everyone refinanced or bought at a low interest rate and can‚Äôt sale because they can‚Äôt afford a home now at present interest rates and if the do sale it has to be at the refinanced price to pay off the loans. \n\nThe fed dropped rates to fast to low and for to long. And then I‚Äôm an attempt to fix there mess they upped the rate to fast and too high. To fix this they need to lower the rates slowly like over 2 years and not anywhere near where they were before.', 'Every reply so far has a point with regards to rising inflation.  They all play a part because one effects another.\n\nYes, US debt is a problem, supply chain issues like chips, embargos on Chinese goods, sending money oversees, people spending spending and continued spending (BTW, Consumer Credit card debt hit a new lifetime high at the beginning of the month).\n\nThen on top of all that, oil prices drive a shit ton of inflation.  Almost every good that reaches a consumers hand has been shipped by a truck and diesel is super high right now.  Oil a few months ago was $63 roughly and is now $80+.  That is a 30% increase. So any consumer who has cut household costs was wiped out by higher oil/gas/Diesel prices and thus inflation continues on. \n\nOne thing that is even hard for me to grasp is how much money many people have.  The last 10+ years of QE has made a shit ton of people rich (mostly the risk takers).  \n\nAround me, any new house built is a McMansion with no lawn and a small garage but damn do they sell like hot cakes.  I sit and wonder who the heck is buying this stuff at these inflated prices.  There are just a lot of upper middle class people that have a lot of money and they also spend a ton too. \n\nA wise man said, ""our imaginations are very limited. "". Yes, some things blow our minds and imaginations.', 'I mean, yes.  All of the above.\n\nSomething most people don\'t get: money flows *through* markets, not into them.  Every transaction has a buyer and a seller and money changing hands; the money that used to be the buyer\'s is now the seller\'s.  When people talk about the value of their bank account, it\'s just a contractual obligation: the actual money has been deposited in the bank, and then loaned out to lots of other people, who have spent it on houses and home improvements and cars and business equipment and salaries.  When people talk about the value of their stock portfolio, it\'s just the number of shares they own times the average price per share that the market is currently trading at.  Prices go up and down depending on supply and demand, and net worths go up and down with them.\n\nWhen the government ""prints"" money, they\'re usually not actually printing money.  The Fed is dropping interest rates to incentivize banks to make more loans, which makes more money flow out into the overall economy.  With more loans, more people buy more things, and economic output goes up.  If there aren\'t enough things to buy, more people instead spend more money to buy the same things, and we call that inflation.\n\nWhen you say ""your average consumer making significantly less then they did last year"", you\'re talking about real dollars, the amount of stuff they can buy with their salaries.  But that\'s begging the question when you speak about inflation.  Inflation is always measured in nominal dollars, because real dollars divide out the inflation rate to get the amount of real stuff you can purchase.  And people aren\'t actually making less: they\'re making *more dollars*, but the dollars are buying less.  Their salaries are just going up at less than the rate of inflation.\n\nWho\'s making more than the rate of inflation, and profiting from it?  Anyone switching jobs - the average job switcher got a 13-15% raise, compared with a 4.5% raise for the average wage.  Anyone who is compensated in stock - the stock market is up \\~60% from 2020.  Anyone  who invested in the right stocks.  Anyone in cryptocurrency - Ethereum was $125 in 2020, now it\'s $1800.  Anyone who bought a house in 2020 with a 3% interest rate and now sees it worth 60% more at a 7% interest rate while they collect 5% on their savings account.  And these winners are *big* winners, so they offset a lot of the hoi polloi who have been just slightly trailing inflation.', ""the government is behind all inflation. they control the amount of inflation that they want there to be. it's their money. The cost to buy stuff is only one factor that is considered when monetary policy is set."", 'Rates go down, people can borrow more, their spending power goes up, and cash is therefore literally worth less.\n\nOr, government prints money, everyone has more money, same thing. This is basically how it works - indirectly.\n\nThis is why CERB screwed things up, and why UBI will probably cause inflation.', 'A manufactured rise of inflation requires no demand. The  monopolies just raise their prices.']"
StockMarket,What Happens When You Miss Time in the Market?,"Professional advisors and amateur gurus alike often point to what happens when an investor misses the top N days in the market. This type of chart often shows how much one misses in their portfolio when not in the market. This is then construed as evidence that market timing is not effective. But what if we turn it around? What if you missed the 10 worst days in the market instead? What if you missed both?

The results are equally as ridiculous. Measuring from 1999 through July 2023, missing the top 10 days in the market led to 0.45x the wealth of a buy and bold strategy. However, missing the worst 10 days leads to 2.4x more wealth than the buy and hold. And if you missed both, then you ended with 1.09x the wealth of the buy and hold.

StockMarket,QQQ vs SPY ratio rollover is happening,"This selloff off the most recent top is not broad based. The big tech darlings are leading the decline.

The QQQ and the SPY are equal for the most part except that the QQQ has a higher weighting of tech while the SPY has oil and gas, banks, and various other non tech sectors.

The strongest sector last week was probably oil and gas. Look at XLE, USO, DBC, etc. All were up.

The last time there was a rollover in the QQQ vs SPY ratio was after the August 2022 top. It didn't go back up until after the bottom in December. The one prior to that was the rollover at the end of 2021. 

The entire market is not melting down. The oil and gas sector is bullish. The VIX is tame. Treasury yields are rising. Big tech retail favorites are getting hit.

StockMarket,"Fund manager Els√§sser: ""Why I advise against ETFs!""","Markus El√§sser is a fund manager who manages a fund that has generated a return of 92 percent over the past 10 years. During the same period, the S&P 500 (SPY ETF) has achieved a return of 164 percent.

Despite his underperformance, he advises against ETFs, which comes as no surprise for a fund manager:

""ETFs are like the fast track for those who don't want to dig deep, just looking for the easy way out. The hard-earned cash I've stacked up isn't going into anything second-rate. I've got an eye for winners ‚Äì solid companies, sectors, and countries. I won't touch those weak assets that some theorist, who's probably out of touch with the real deal, shoves into or kicks out of their index. That's not how I roll.

People are talking a lot about how ETFs are a great investment, but let me explain it simply. When things get tough, those ETFs won't provide any answers or help. Now, imagine I have a million Swiss francs invested in Roche stock. I'd definitely contact their investor relations, asking detailed questions about their debts, liabilities, and everything else. Here's the interesting part: if you invest with a fund manager who's actively managing a fund, you're investing in something that has a say. It's like having a direct line of communication. Don't miss out on this important point.

Listen closely, my friend. When the ETF is doing really well, everyone is celebrating and having a good time. But wait, what happens when things aren't going well? Imagine it's 3 AM, and an investor is awake and suddenly their partner asks, ""Is our investment really safe?"" The ETF believer might say, ""Don't worry, it's all part of this index strategy. We're riding the overall market trend."" But wait a second, weren't there some big failures like Enron in that same market? That's when they start feeling uncertain and searching for something reliable. Now, let's look at a different situation. I'm investing in strong, well-established companies, even if I'm just an average person.

Fast forward to 4 AM, and I'm telling my partner, ""You can be sure we're holding shares in consumer goods companies. Do you really think people will stop buying skincare just because the market is having some issues?""

StockMarket,SP500 Futures Technical Analysis & Trading Plan,"*I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas.*

***Recap***: It‚Äôs been a day trading paradise lately and today brought more intraday volatility, a trader‚Äôs best friend. In this volatility, there were very many tradeable setups from the plan. The one that I took was mapped directly to this part of the plan: *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still important for bulls to hold the line at* ***4506*** *and I would look for a recovery of the level from below‚Äù*. Right after CPI was released, the market put in a quick auction down to major support at **4494** and then recovered **4506**. I entered here and exited the majority of the trade at the next level at **4518**. I left a runner to get taken out by a trailing stop.¬†

As I often do, I switched to paper trading and traded three other scenarios from the plan, each of which set up perfectly: 1) The short from **4518** down to **4506**; 2) Support at **4483**, exiting at **4494**; 3) Support at **4494** and exiting at **4506**.

***Balance/Trend***: The market remains in a trend down over the past week or so and we have now seen a 160-point selloff from the recent peak at about **4635.** The market is now in a broadening pattern described below, but the most recent action has certainly been down. The market is now hovering at the inner bound of the aqua trendline channel, but the lows at **4458** need to hold if this trend is to stay.

***Analysis***: The market tested **4494** (and surrounding levels) on six separate occasions over the last week and rallied each time to about **4545**, creating what appears to be a broadening descending wedge pattern with the red line as resistance and the lower dotted black line as support. If anybody knows more about this pattern, please chime in. The market is still filling it out and statistically, usually sees a breakout to the upside and continuation. Inside of this pattern, there is a lot of volatility (that‚Äôs what created it) and so we may still see these swings up and down while the market finds its footing. Today‚Äôs close near the lows are not exactly encouraging, but with more important data ahead tomorrow, we have to wait to see if this means anything.

***Levels***

* Potential support: **4475-78**, **4466-69, 4458, 4449, 4438, 4411**
* Potential resistance: **4489, 4494-98, 4507, 4522, 4540-45, 4571, 4577**

StockMarket,What is a good strategy to follow when selling a stock while you are down?,"I used to work at company C, and they gave me a lot of stock. And some I bought in the form of Employee Share Purchase Program.

Anyways, while I was there, stock was doing great - I kept holding it like the dumbass that I am. Lo and be hold, stock now is 1/3 of where it used to be.

I do not have trust in this company, nor do I think they will do well in the future.

What do I do with this stock? Should I just sell it all at once so I can sleep better at night and put in on some index funds ? Or should I just hold it until better days come?

Our 3rd quarter used to always be the best - so maybe I wait until then?

What is some good strategy to follow when you are trying to sell some stock that you do not believe in anymore?

Lesson learned.","['[https://imgur.com/a/NUYwNod](https://imgur.com/a/NUYwNod) PYPL weekly Chart\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to make decisions in the stock market. Some people like to buy strength, as a stock price is going up, while some prefer to buy weakness, when the stock is going down or is down.\n\nThere is a saying; ""Gravity only works going down"". That is referencing that a stock price can drop over nothing, but it usually takes real work by the company to get their stock price up. And a stock price can always go down, there is no magic that makes it rebound up. PYPL is down 79% since it peaked in July 2021. Even a $1 stock can still drop 50%.\n\nOTOH if you bought AAPL 10 years ago & just held it, you did really fantastically well. Up 900%. But AAPL has been mostly in an uptrend.\n\nPretty much any stock chart will have an option to add a Moving Average, or Simple Moving Average. Maybe we can tell you how. What brokerage (or chart website) are you using?\n\nThat said, some people might sell it all immediately, before it drops more. Some might sell half, or 1/4, then sell another chunk later hoping to catch a better price on their sell. And some people will not sell, but buy because they think it will go up.\n\nSupply & Demand drives everything.\n\nThe real truth is that nobody really knows the future. We are all forced to make decisions with incomplete information. There is a great book about that; ""Thinking in Bets"" by Annie Duke.\n\nYou\'ve said that in your opinion this stock does not have good future prospects. If that is how you feel, then you\'re going to want to sell all or part to at least begin the divesting process.\n\nPYPL stock has been mostly going down for the past 2 years, so I can see why you\'d lose interest in it. The stock might go up again, someday. In which case you can buy it again if you want to. The key point is that (speaking generally here) you only make money when a stock goes up in price. So it makes sense to own stocks that go up.\n\nSELL RULES: One of the many ways to manage a stock position is to sell the stock, or at least sell some of it, if/when the price drops under the 50 day (10 week) moving average line for a reasonable amount of time. That\'s a simple and reasonable sell rule. There are other buy & sell rules too.\n\nOne Sell Rule says Sell if the price drops under & stays under the 50 day SMA line for 4 weeks or maybe 6 weeks. If it\'s a stock you really like & prefer to hodl longer term then use 8 weeks. How long really depends on your own time frame. IBD often recommends looking at a weekly chart (each candle stick is 1 week), not so much the daily chart (each candle stick is 1 day). Helps reduce the ""noise"".\n\nLooking back, if you had started selling your position when the stock dropped under the 50 day line for 6 weeks you would have exited a long time ago, Possibly Oct 4th, 2021 when it was about $262. It helps to have some sell rules figured out in advance.\n\nIf you\'re not sure if you should sell, try selling just a portion. Something like 10% to 30% & see how it goes. Do you feel better?  Sell just a portion of your position is often a good plan. You can feel OK about it no matter what happens next. Either you\'re happy you stayed partly in the game, or you\'re happy you got some cash out when you did. HTH', 'Depending on your cost basis and how many shares you have you could sell covered calls till they get assigned', ""My advice would be don't sell.

StockMarket,Apple's Fiscal Year 2022: Diving into the Numbers,"Hello everyone,

I've recently taken a deep dive into Apple's fiscal report for 2022, and a couple of figures stood out to me. Using the graphic I've examined, I've observed some interesting revenue shifts. Most notably, there's an 8% decrease in iPad revenue, a significant drop considering Apple's usual stability in the tablet market. Additionally, when breaking down revenue by region, Japan ‚Äì traditionally a strong market for Apple ‚Äì has experienced a 9% drop in revenue.

Several factors might contribute to these shifts ‚Äì product lifecycle, competition, market saturation, local economic conditions, or even changes in consumer preferences. Still, these drops seem quite ""high"", especially for such a colossal company.

Does anyone have insights or theories about why Apple saw a decrease in these specific areas?

Thank you in advance

StockMarket,How much trouble are legacy auto makers in?,"As we all know legacy OEMs were very late to the party with BEVs. These are massive companies that can overcome a lot and absorb a lot of losses, but it‚Äôs getting to the point that I‚Äôm starting to think that some of these big companies are not going to pull out of this auto renaissance, still in business. 

For starters, they operate through dealerships who have had to increase prices on constrained availability in order to profit. Even with the dealer markups most dealers are down a lot. When things go back to normal naturally I would think those profits will evaporate. Furthermore the OEMs don‚Äôt get very good market data because it has to go through dealers before it gets back to them. They are somewhat blind with sales data until it‚Äôs presented to them so translating that into demand for production forecasts is a nightmare while changing over to EV productions. 

The part that is most scary is that most OEMs committed to going full force with BEVs, only to find that they are not selling as they had hoped, especially in a high interest environment. So the problem is that not only are they nowhere close to profiting, they aren‚Äôt selling well so they are now pulling back on production. If they can‚Äôt sell, they can‚Äôt profit and if you can‚Äôt profit you can‚Äôt scale

Scaling is by far the hardest part and if you scale before you can profit you will be going out of business. Losing money on a few EVs is one thing but losing money on each one at scale is a death sentence. Ford is an example of high ambition but now they are pulling back because they aren‚Äôt selling their BEVs. 

How is this really going to play out for legacy makers in a competitive market when more and more people buy EVs and less and less buy gas cars? They can‚Äôt raise prices because there will be better cars for less. At low prices they can‚Äôt profit or scale. I just can‚Äôt see a clear path for them at this point.","['>For starters, they operate through dealerships who have had to increase prices on constrained availability in order to profit.

Plus they have to support their entire 'gas car' infrastructure.  In effect the legacy automakers are like a hybrid car, you have to support two businesses simultaneously which is the best or worst of both worlds depending on your vantage point."", '> Losing money on a few EVs is one thing but losing money on each one at scale is a death sentence.\n\nYou are buying into a fallacy the media pushes.

It\'s going to soak up most of their cash at a time when cash is hard to come by, and when they need it to scale BEV.\n\nTesla starting a price war right now is 100% an attempt to financially slit throats.\n\nIf legacy auto survives that, they need to also spend tens of billions to scale BEV while writing down hundreds of billions of gas-related assets, patents, goodwill, etc.  (see: GE\'s $200b writedown a few years ago). Given that the wealthy 50% of the world population lives under a govt with gas-sunset laws already on the books, that\'s going to be a requirement for them.\n\nDon\'t even get me started on pension liabilities, unions, corporate inertia, lack of vertical integration, lack of BEV raw material supply... it\'s a perfect storm.\n\nAnd the newcomers and the chinese are waiting to eat their lunch.\n\nHonestly I\'d rather see the govt investing in the newcomers rather than life support for legacy auto.

StockMarket,Lowering Fed Rates Question.,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that rates get lowered when there is a need to stimulate the economy. Things like COVID, 9/11 or 2008 (major events) that essentially disrupt both demand and supply.

There is speculation that the fed will lower rates soon just to lower rates. I'm not sure I fully understand why anyone would think the fed would do this. Not only are we **not** at the fed's target for inflation, but we have a ways to go if we want to get there.

If the fed decided to lower rates for no reason other than stimulating the economy, I would expect to see a surge in inflation again. For example, we paused rates in June and a month later, inflation went up again. Imagine what lower rates would do. Especially if we lowered them and disaster struck.

I can understand lowering rates if inflation was clearly going down and rates were high like they were in the 70's or 80's. However, rates aren't that high and the means to stimulate the economy without having to deal with inflation are extremely thin. That is a massive liability for the fed to take if they did this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Answer:  

>When rates change, there are short term effects and long term effects. The high inflation you see now is related to the low interest rates over the past 1-2 years as it overstimulated the economy driving prices to inflate. As we‚Äôve now raised rates nearly a dozen times in 2023 at a quick pace, we‚Äôll most likely see the long term effects in mid-late 2024 and there is a more than likely overshoot which is why speculation is rates will lower a bit in Q4 2024 to bring it back up slightly. Rate effects take time to be realized throughout the economy and may also change direction as other factors come into play between now and Q4 2024. 

&#x200B;","['Unlike the 70s and 80s we have 30 trillion dollars of debt, so higher interest rates means larger interest payments on the debt. Currently the interest payment on the debt will be one trillion dollars. That is not paying down any of the principal. You see the problem?', ""The yield curve is inverted. That was intended to slow down the economy and ultimately reduce inflation. The market has anticipated for months that the Fed's work is nearly done and a normal yield curve would take shape where short term rates are lower than long term rates. Normalizing the yield curve was the reason nearly everyone expected short term rates to go back down, initiated by Fed rate cuts.\n\nRecently, the market's mood is less certain that short term rates are going down soon.\n\nThe market is starting to price in the possibility that the yield curve will normalize by long term rates rising more than short term rates falling. This change is now gaining popularity because people are realizing that reducing the inflation rate from 3% to 2% is going to be a lot harder than it was getting it from 10% to 3%."", 'You will see the Fed raise rates again before they liwer rhe. In perhaps the 2nd quarter 2024.\n\nWhatever made you think that the US economy needs some stimulation?', ""You're right when you say lowering rates in general will stimulate the economy. The reason most people think that the Fed will cut rates soon is that they think there will be immaculate disinflation and the Fed will reach their target inflation or at least close to it sooner than everyone thinks.   \n\n\nThe other thought process is that the Fed will be done once the US reaches 3%. While this is somewhat true, I don't believe that the Fed will be very quick to cut rates. Most likely they will cut before hitting the 2% inflation mark but it will probably be once inflation is well below 3% and stays there. And I think the cuts will be very gradual.   \n\n\nComing back to your main question, why the Fed would cut at all is because the view is that the hiking right now is much to aggressive and the economy just needs positive real rates across the curve. Real rates = Bond Yield + Inflation Rate. So once inflation is back down below 3% the Fed can cut and bring down rates to 3% and still have positive real rates. \n\nHope that makes sense."", 'Speculation that the federal prime rate will lower from where? \n\nIf you follow the FOMC meetings (who determine rate changes), you‚Äôd have seen that they‚Äôre hesitant on changing rates anymore in 2023. However, the FOMC has restated numerous times their goal is to achieve maximum employment and a long term inflation rate of 2% (last inflation report on August 10, 2023 was 3.2%). As such, current estimates are holding or a 25 point basis raise for the rest of 2023. \n\nAs for 2024, varying vastly based upon the economy or inflation, current estimates are that rates will marginally lower than current in Q4 2024. Why? Because rates take time to see a long-term effect and an overshoot from 2023 rate changes is expected.', 'Decision makers make interest rate decisions based on economic data and macroeconomic analysis. The purpose of lowering interest rates is usually to stimulate the economy, but decision makers need to carefully weigh various factors, including inflationary pressures and the performance of the economy and job market.', 'What has not shown up is the effect of all these concluded, or current, labor negotiations/strikes.  That will increase incomes a lot, if they get what they want.  Slowly, for at least several months to come, this will all work its way to the bottom line of every single thing you buy.   The Fed knows this.', ""Well, maybe we should pay the debt? Wouldn't that seem like the better choice over hyper-inflation plus having to pay that debt? The longer they kick the can, the higher the rates will have to be. There's no avoiding it unless a revolution happens and a new government/central bank is created."", 'Truth here, and as the fed prints its way out forcing more inflation, due to the decline of dollar reserve currency prominance, those interest rates will have to remain elevated to incentivize holding such shit debt.', 'This is what happens when market speculation and fraud run rampant for too long. The younger \'investors\' are on YouTube telling other amateurs how to rig the system in their favor with multi-family home bridge loans and telling them that if they don\'t buy a $700k house now, it will be $900k in 2025, so buy now with 3% down. It isn\'t about stimulation for them, they think the Fed won\'t ever hurt them in the short term in order to save the economy in the long term.\n\nNone of these people understand credit or liquidity. I was reading an article about Macy\'s today and they ""baked in"" credit card delinquency increase for 2023 but they underestimated and now they have to go back to their bank to figure out how to cover.']"

The choice of a three-year period holds significance due to its capacity to capture a range of market conditions, including one bear market that has occurred within that timeframe.

I selected four stock recommendations from each bank and equally weighted them for the analysis. Here is the performance of the three banks I scrutinized:

* Goldman Sachs exhibited remarkable performance, boasting an annualized return of 21% over the designated period.
* UBS and Jefferies, on the other hand, demonstrated relatively comparable outcomes, staying relatively neck and neck in their performance.
* Both UBS and Jefferies significantly lagged behind Goldman Sachs, achieving a mere 8% annualized return.

StockMarket,"Fundamentals aside, NVDA is behaving as an AI ETF","While many AI startups are making waves in the industry, few have reached the stage of going public, leaving a void in the public markets for AI-focused investments.  I think NVIDIA currently serves as a de facto investment vehicle for those bullish on AI, an effective proxy for AI growth, acting in essence as an AI ETF. 

Which brings the question, why are new AI companies so shy on going public? In contrast with other ""bubbles"" (e.g dot-com) we are not seeing a lot of action. These companies could capture a lot of interest that now is funnelling to NVDA, MSFT and some other chip companies.","['No, Nvidia is a company that makes massive revenues and profits that inure directly to the benefit of its owners and no one else.  \n\nETFs are just jumbles of different stocks over which the investor has no control.', '[removed]', 'You can say that for any of the markets they provide GPUs to.

StockMarket,Unemployment is here,"The data is saying unemployment is about to go up. Are you listening?

Let's stick to the facts. At the end of every business cycle, the economy gets sick and unemployment rate goes way up. The fed intervenes to save the economy. The cycle begins again. It's natural. Inevitable.

What happens when unemployment goes way up? Everyone capitulates. The only thing anybody cares about is getting the employment rate back up. To make the economy not sick. Employment controls the market. That's when the stock market unwinds. Capitulates.

What if we could predict when this would occur? Well, let's find a leading indicator and that should tell us if we're close. Well folks, there is one. And it's close. I've been watching this since 2022. Patiently waiting for today.

Say hello to initial claims. Initial unemployment claims are now behaving differently now than before. It continues to bounce higher exactly from the new support. This is a meaningful signal. It's building structural strength. It hasn't retested support since before COVID. This is what proceeds the real bear market.

Signal is signal.

StockMarket,SP500 Technical Analysis & Trading Plan,"*I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas. This plan uses the futures market for levels.* 

***Recap***: I noted in the plan for today that the market was finding some near term balance, and trying to trade too many levels or setups in this environment usually leads to losses. There were several pieces of the plan that would have worked for today though, and the goal is always to catch one of them. 

In the plan for today, there were several setups that I mapped out that I could have (or maybe should have) traded. One such setup was at the key support zone at **4494-98** and I said that I would look to play it either as support at **4487** or that another option would be to *‚Äúlet the market test below the Friday lows and try to reclaim that range in order to get into a long.‚Äù* I took this trade at about 12:30 EST, just before the market settled into an hour-long \~8-point range that really tested my patience. Volume entered the market and I exited the majority of the trade at the next level **4506** and left a runner to exit at the pink trendline at **4522**. 

***Balance/Trend***: The market traded lower overnight and then sharply rejected yesterday‚Äôs range at the open today. The primary structure right now is the downtrend outlined in black. The market is still holding both of the aqua blue trend lines which define the trend from March, so this is still the bigger trend to watch. 

***Analysis***: The market is working inside of the down-sloping black channel in the charts and found support there today for the third time, coinciding with another backtest to the ascending triangle structure (in pink) at **4494**. The market broke out from this structure on July 12 (this was also the basis for the **4487** support level) and it‚Äôs important that bulls hold these levels if this breakout is to remain intact. With no economic releases tomorrow ahead of inflation data on the backend of the week, it would not surprise me to see periods of chop tomorrow. 

It is now essential that bulls hold **4506** for a sustained move higher and in an effort to reclaim the pink trendline at **4527**. With this level breaking down twice now though and today‚Äôs close beneath it, it‚Äôs on the verge of irrelevance. Moving back inside of this trend though could accelerate the bull case and push the market back to testing the expanding range lows (**4547-50**) and then the very important balance area which has already been retested once at **4559**. 

***Plan***: 

* Potential support levels: **4506, 4494-98, 4489, 4483, 4479, 4466, 4447**, **4438**
* Potential resistance levels: **4527**, **4536-38, 4547-50, 4559, 4589-93, 4597, 4609**

SPACs,[DIY Filing Alerts] Part 1: Working with the SEC API,"# Intro

Suppose you would like to be immediately notified each time the SEC publishes a filing for a ticker you follow. This series of posts will cover the parts involved to programmatically access the filing data and eventually make your own [notifications@sec.report](mailto:notifications@sec.report) clone. We will be building the script as we go, hopefully ending with a system that runs on its own. Not yet sure how many parts in this series there will be...

Part 1 will cover API basics.

What you will need:

* Computer
* Basic knowledge of how files and folders are stored on said computer
* Internet connection
* Email address (preferably two), I will be using GMail in the examples

The code to be typed in by you will be in the code blocks and at the end of this post I will have one code block with it all inside.

We will be using *PowerShell* as our programming language. It is pre-installed on every Windows computer so there is nothing for you to configure or setup to start using it. PowerShell does run on Mac and Linux but will have to be [installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.3).

To start PowerShell on your PC, right click the Start Menu and select *Windows PowerShell.* You can also click the Windows Search and type in *PowerShell*. Open PowerShell and you are now left at the prompt, ready to type.

&#x200B;

[PowerShell icon on the Windows taskbar](https://preview.redd.it/vqh1hkhdcxfb1.png?width=61&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc97d2a39cc3ff184b4f1b34a1512db899b31ed4)

&#x200B;

# Setup the API Endpoint

The API endpoint is the coding *interface* we need to freely access what's stored on the [sec.gov](https://sec.gov) website via the console. The endpoint reaches out to the SEC and the code is typed in a format that the website recognizes so it can then run a query with our ticker and *respond* with the filing data.

The endpoint is made up of three parts, a cmdlet and two parameters

1. The cmdlet we will be using is *Invoke-RestMethod*. This PowerShell command is what instructs the computer to reach out to the Internet.
2. Parameter one is *Headers.* The headers let the SEC website know who we are.
3. Parameter two is *URI*. Think of this a website, telling the computer where to look.

&#x200B;

**Headers**

To remain compliant with the [SEC's rules](https://www.sec.gov/os/webmaster-faq#developers) and gain access to the data our headers need to include information on who we are. Thankfully, that is only an email address.

Store your email address in a variable by typing:

    $fromEmail = 'youremailaddress@gmail.com'

Press the enter key at the end of the line. The variable name is $fromEmail (all variables in PowerShell start with $)

Create and store our API headers in a variable:

    $hdrs = @{""User-Agent"" = ""personal use $fromEmail""}

The ""User-Agent"" part of this line declares who we are.

&#x200B;

**URI**

The [SEC API documentation](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation) states that to programmatically check company filing data we actually need to search by company CIK, not ticker. Since we can remember tickers much easier, we will make our script look up the CIK for us.

I will be using a ticker that I know has filings dated today (Aug 3 2023), CHAA. To find a list of companies that have filed today, check [latest filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent).

CIK information for all companies can be found on the [company tickers site](https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json) (formatted in a style called JSON) so lets save that in a variable:

    $tickerSite = 'https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json'

$tickerSite will be the URI we will use to lookup the CIK.

&#x200B;

**Use Inovke-RestMethod to call the API**

To pick out the the CIK that is associated with CHAA we will have to search for it.

Store CIK data for all companies in a variable by calling the API using the three parts of the endpoint:

    $tickerResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $hdrs -uri $tickerSite

If you enter ""$tickerResponse"" (no quotes) at your prompt, you will see everything on your console that's in the above link, displayed on screen as an *object*. Listed in this object is every company registered with the SEC. Notice the numbers in the left column.

&#x200B;

**Find the ticker's CIK**

Store the ticker in a variable (we will go over looking up multiple tickers in a different post):

    $ticker = 'CHAA'

Remember the column with the numbers? We have to match the number that has $ticker in it, which also has the CHAA CIK, labeled in the object as ""cik\_str.""

Store the numbers in a variable. I've added some code in the *pipeline* (this part: | ) to tell the computer how to separate the numbers from everything else:

    $responseNumbers = ($tickerResponse | Get-Member | Where-Object {$_.membertype -eq 'NoteProperty'}).Name

Now we have to check each one of the numbers to see if it contains $ticker (CHAA), extract the CIK, and then you guessed it, store it in a variable:

    foreach ($number in $responseNumbers) {
        if ($tickerResponse.$number.ticker -eq $ticker) {
            $cik = ($tickerResponse.$number).cik_str.ToString().padLeft(10,'0')
        }
    }

The code reads: for each number in the numbers response, check to see if the number's ticker section equals our ticker. If it does, take that line and extract the CIK (in the object it is called cik\_str) and store it in the $cik variable. The bits at the end make sure its a 10 digit CIK (by adding three zeroes), which we will need later to search for the filings.

Type $cik and viola, we have our CIK

    PS C:\> $cik
    0001838293

&#x200B;

# Grab All the Filings

Since the filing data is on a different [site](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1838293) we will make a new URI, and call the API for a new response.

&#x200B;

**Filing URI**

The SEC API [documentation](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation) says:

\>  Each entity‚Äôs current filing history is available at the following URL:

\> [https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK\*\*##########\*\*.json](https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK**##########**.json)

\> Where the **##########** is the entity‚Äôs 10-digit Central Index Key (CIK), including leading zeros.

Store the above site in a variable, use the existing $cik variable to fill in the # symbols:

    $filingUri = ""https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK$cik.json""

Optionally, check the variable:

    PS C:\> $filingUri
    https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK0001838293.json

&#x200B;

**Filing Response**

Store the response for filings in a new variable, use the existing headers:

    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $hdrs -uri $filingUri

This response gives us a lot of information we'd normally find on the filing website:

    PS C:\> $response
    
    
    cik                               : 0001838293

    filings                           : @{recent=; files=System.Object[]}

**Enumerate Filings**

The last line has the filings nested in curly braces. Lets enumerate those and see what's inside. Enumerate by adding a period, followed by what we want, which is filings but also recent filings. Store recent filings in a variable (didn't see that coming!):

    $recent = $response.filings.recent

Between $response and $recent we have everything we need to recreate what we'd like to be notified about.

&#x200B;

# Build a Custom Object

Lets cherry pick what we want to be notified about and keep it all in one special variable, called an object. In this example we will pick the most recent filing AKA the last filing to be filed so far. We will do so by enumerating the company name, the ticker, the filing date, form, and a link which will take us to the filing. Type each one in the console to verify, then we'll throw 'em all together at the end.

&#x200B;

**Company Name**

    $response.name

**Ticker**

    $response.tickers[0]

I'm using a \[0\] at the end to pick the most recent (read: first) of the group of tickers (0 comes before 1).

**Filing Date**

    $recent.filingDate[0]

**Form**

    $recent.form[0]

**Link**

We will have to build the link:

    $secWebsite = 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data'

then

    $accessionNumber = $response.filings.recent.accessionNumber[0] -replace '[-]',''

*-replace '\[-\]',''*  removes the hyphens from the number

**Build the Custom Object With the Above Bits**

    $obj = [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $response.name
        Tickers = $response.tickers[0]
        FilingDate = $recent.filingDate[0]
        Form = ($recent).form[0]
        Link = $secWebsite + '/' + $cik + '/' + $accessionNumber + '/' + $recent.primaryDocument[0]
    }

Note: the parts between the { } are indented but don't have to be when you are typing at the prompt. You can press enter to go to the next line until the second curly brace is close. The ""link"" is all one line (not sure how it will show up in this post).

Type $obj into to the console:

    PS H:\> $obj
    
    
    Name       : Catcha Investment Corp
    Tickers    : CHAA
    FilingDate : 2023-08-03
    Form       : 425
    Link       : https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001838293/000121390023063003/ea182835-425_catchainvest.htm

Woot! Copying and pasting the link into your browser will take you to the filing.

&#x200B;

# Combining the Snippits

If you were to copy and paste an entire snippit of code for this, it would look like:

    $fromEmail = 'youremailaddress@gmail.com'
    $hdrs = @{""User-Agent"" = ""personal use $fromEmail""}
    $tickerSite = 'https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json'
    $tickerResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $hdrs -uri $tickerSite
    $ticker = 'CHAA'
    $responseNumbers = ($tickerResponse | Get-Member | Where-Object {$_.membertype -eq 'NoteProperty'}).Name
    foreach ($number in $responseNumbers) {
        if ($tickerResponse.$number.ticker -eq $ticker) {
            $cik = ($tickerResponse.$number).cik_str.ToString().padLeft(10,'0')
        }
    }
    $filingUri = ""https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK$cik.json""
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $hdrs -uri $filingUri
    $recent = $response.filings.recent
    $secWebsite = 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data'
    $accessionNumber = $response.filings.recent.accessionNumber[0] -replace '[-]',''
    $obj = [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $response.name
        Tickers = $response.tickers[0]
        FilingDate = $recent.filingDate[0]
        Form = ($recent).form[0]
        Link = $secWebsite + '/' + $cik + '/' + $accessionNumber + '/' + $recent.primaryDocument[0]
    }
    $obj

Don't forget to swap out ""youremailaddress.' Each time you run this it will check for the latest filing and display the info in a neat little object.

&#x200B;

This post will cover

* Checking filings for multiple tickers at once
* Isolating filings from today only
* Emailing the filing links to yourself

&#x200B;

# Setup: Tickers and CIKs

On your computer open [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/powershell).

&#x200B;

**Existing Variables**

We will be reusing some variables from [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/15hgoiy/diy_filing_alerts_part_1_working_with_the_sec_api/), lets start typing those in to store them in memory:

    $fromEmail = 'youremailaddress@gmail.com'

Recommending GMail because my example will need a GMail [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) (will go over this further down).

And since we're emailing:

    $toEmail = 'yoursecondemail@address.com'

I recommend a separate second email because sometimes if you email yourself the notifications don't show up on your phone, YMMV, making them both the same won't break the script.

API Headers:

    $hdrs = @{""User-Agent"" = ""personal use $fromEmail""}

API URI:

    $tickerSite = 'https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json'

Call the API to get ticker CIKs for all companies:

    $tickerResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $hdrs -uri $tickerSite

SEC Website

    $secWebsite = 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data'

&#x200B;

**Create a List of Tickers**

This will build on the ""Find the ticker's CIK"" section in part 1. Open Notepad on your computer. Enter a ticker, then create a new line for each ticker.

My Notepad ticker list will be:

    TMPO
    DKDCA

but you can add as many as you like, as long as they are each on their own line. I know for today (Aug 4 2023) each of those have filings (3 and 2 respectively) so we should expect 5 email alerts when we're done. For a list of companies who have submitted filings for today check [latest filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcurrent).

In Notepad, click the *File* menu, then *Save As...* give it a name (doesn't matter what you name it) but make sure it ends in .csv. Mine is called tickers.csv

[Notepad](https://preview.redd.it/15g3kim7t4gb1.png?width=261&format=png&auto=webp&s=9809a8b0cc850ad163912316345ba5e7241019ae)

Take note of the folder you've saved this csv file in. Mine is C:\\temp

[tickers.csv in the temp folder, the icon type is irrelevant](https://preview.redd.it/jvcuoqiit4gb1.png?width=391&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f5d88ad6a5ca764cacbdf4e7f36fdb5ee960baa)

Save the folder in a variable:

    $folder = 'c:\temp'

Make sure there are no other CSV files in this folder.

&#x200B;

**Import Tickers into PowerShell**

Our CSV will need a header (read: column title):

    $csvHeader = 'Ticker'

Next we will import the tickers in our list and add the header:

    $csv = Import-Csv -Path $folder\*.CSV -Header $csvHeader

To make it easier for our script to manipulate data, we are going to load each ticker into a special list called a *hashset.* Store the hashset into a variable:

    $tickerList = [Collections.Generic.Hashset[String]]@()

The hashset $tickerList is empty so we will instruct PowerShell to add each ticker from our CSV into it:

    foreach ($item in $csv) {
        $tickerList.Add($item.ticker)
    }

The above code reads: for each item in our CSV, add it to the tickerList hashset. If there are two tickers like in my example, the code will run through twice, if there are three, thrice, four times, not sure of the word for that, and so on...

&#x200B;

**Find a CIK for each Ticker**

Refer to ""Find the ticker's CIK"" in [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/15hgoiy/diy_filing_alerts_part_1_working_with_the_sec_api/) if you need, because we will be building off that.

Manipulate the $tickerResponse variable so its in a format we can use to match row number, to ticker, to CIK:

    $responseNumbers = ($tickerResponse | Get-Member | Where-Object {$_.membertype -eq 'NoteProperty'}).Name

Make a new hashset to store the CIKs:

    $cikList = [Collections.Generic.Hashset[String]]@()

We will use the same code from part 1 but since we have multiple tickers we will put that inside of another foreach, but then also add the found CIK into the hashset:

    foreach ($number in $responseNumbers) {
        foreach ($ticker in $tickerList) {
            if ($tickerResponse.$number.ticker -eq $ticker) {
                $cik_str = ($tickerResponse.$number).cik_str.ToString().padLeft(10,'0')
                $cikList.Add($cik_str)
            }
        }  
    }

Optionally, check $ciklist to see what you got:

    PS C:\> $ciklist
    0001849380
    0001813658

&#x200B;

# Grab All the Filings

Per the SEC API [documentation](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation)

>Each entity‚Äôs current filing history is available at the following URL:  
>  
>[https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK\*\*##########\*\*.json](https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK**##########**.json)  
>  
>Where the ########## is the entity‚Äôs 10-digit Central Index Key (CIK), including leading zeros.

We'll use that link (with the $cik variable replacing the # symbols) as our API URI.

Before we write the code I like to think through what's happening...

* Each ticker will need its own filing *response*
* We only want filings from today
* Since we're checking for filings all day, we don't want filings we've already been alerted about
* Lastly email the filings

&#x200B;

Lets think of the bullet points in terms of code. *No need to type in these code blocks for this section*. I'm just using them so you can recognize the individual pieces when we put all the bullets together.

* We have a $cikList full of $ciks
* *foreach* $cik, create a $filingUri and call the API for a $resonse, but only if the company has filings dated today (we'll use the variable $logDate to represent today)

&#x200B;

    foreach ($cik in $cikList) {
        $filingUri = ""https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK$cik.json""
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $hdrs -uri $filingUri |
                Where-Object {$_.filings.recent.filingDate -like ""*$logDate*""}
        Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 100
    
        # space for other bullet points
        
    }

Note: I've added the *Start-Sleep* line becuase the SEC [says](https://www.sec.gov/os/webmaster-faq#developers) we're only allowed to check 10 CIKs per second; we have to purposely slow down the script otherwise they will block us.

* the $response is only usable to us if it includes filings from today's date, otherwise skip it

&#x200B;

    if ($response) {
    
        # space for bullet points
    
    }

* *if* there are *truly* $responses where the $logdate is today's date *then* count how many their are

&#x200B;

    $i = (
        $response.filings.recent.filingDate | Group-Object | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $logDate }
    ).Count

Note: $i represents the total number of filings (an integer)

* Start with the first filing (remember 0 is the first filing, 1 is the second...)

&#x200B;

    $n = 0

* Determine a unique identifier - I'm using the filing's *Accession Number* which we know how to get from part 1

&#x200B;

    $accessionNumber = $response.filings.recent.accessionNumber[$n] -replace '[-]',''

* create a hashset to store the Accession Numbers after we've emailed them

&#x200B;

    $spacFilings = [Collections.Generic.Hashset[PSCustomObject]]@()

* check to see if the accession number is already in the spacFilings hashset, if the hashset does not contain it, grab the recent filings and move on to the next bullet point. If it does, skip this filing

&#x200B;

    if ($spacFilings.accessionNumber -notcontains $accessionNumber) {
        $recent = $response.filings.recent
    
        # object will go here
    
    }

* create an $obj for the first filing, then the next. See ""Build a Custom Object"" in part 1 for more of an explanation on building the object

&#x200B;

    $obj = [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $response.name
        Tickers = $response.tickers[0]
        AccessionNumber = $accessionNumber
        FilingDate = $recent.filingDate[$n]
        Form = ($recent).form[$n]
        Link = $secWebsite + '/' + $cik + '/' + $accessionNumber + '/' + $recent.primaryDocument[$n]
    }

* email the filing
   * We will need some new variables to send a gmail, [create an app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) and write it down for later. We'll type the variables in a few minutes.
   * create the email using data from the above $obj

&#x200B;

    $subject = ""$($obj.tickers) | New SEC filing""
    $body = ""Name: $($obj.name) `n`nTicker: $($obj.tickers) `n`nFiling Date: $($obj.filingdate) `n`nForm: $($obj.form) `n`nLink: $($obj.link)""

* send the email

&#x200B;

    Send-MailMessage -From $fromEmail -To $toEmail -Subject $subject -Body $body -SmtpServer 'smtp.gmail.com' -Port 587 -UseSsl -Credential $credential

* *do* this *until* we've looped through however many new filings we've found

&#x200B;

    do {
    
        # bullet points go here
    
    } until (
        $n -ge $i
    )

Note ""ge"" stands for *greater than or equal*.

&#x200B;

**Putting all the Bullet Points of Code Together**

Before we combine the above lines, we need to add some variables. *Now you can type them.*

Today's date:

    $logDate = Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd

Filings hashset:

    $spacFilings = [Collections.Generic.Hashset[PSCustomObject]]@()

GMail App Password

    $pass = ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'App Password with no hyphens goes between single quotes' -AsPlainText -Force

GMail credential

    $credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $fromEmail, $pass

Set security protocols for sending (this may or may not be needed but we're adding it anyway):

    [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11

Bullet points combined into script:

    foreach ($cik in $cikList) {
        $n = 0
        $filingUri = ""https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK$cik.json""
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers $hdrs -uri $filingUri |
            Where-Object {$_.filings.recent.filingDate -like ""*$logDate*""}
        Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 100
    
        # do the thing only if there are filings from today     
        if ($response) {
            # determine number of filings with today's date 
            $i = (
                    $response.filings.recent.filingDate | Group-Object | Where-Object {
                        $_.Name -eq $logDate }
            ).Count
    
            # collect filings from today
                
            do {
                $accessionNumber = $response.filings.recent.accessionNumber[$n] -replace '[-]',''
                    
                # Check if Filing was Already Checked
                if ($spacFilings.accessionNumber -notcontains $accessionNumber) {
                    $recent = $response.filings.recent
                    $obj = [PSCustomObject]@{
                        Name = $response.name
                        Tickers = $response.tickers[0]
                        AccessionNumber = $accessionNumber
                        FilingDate = $recent.filingDate[$n]
                        Form = ($recent).form[$n]
                        Link = $secWebsite + '/' + $cik + '/' + $accessionNumber + '/' + $recent.primaryDocument[$n]
                    }
                        
                    # create / send email
                    $subject = ""$($obj.tickers) | New SEC filing""
                    $body = ""Name: $($obj.name) `n`nTicker: $($obj.tickers) `n`nFiling Date: $($obj.filingdate) `n`nForm: $($obj.form) `n`nLink: $($obj.link)""
                    Send-MailMessage -From $fromEmail -To $toEmail -Subject $subject -Body $body -SmtpServer 'smtp.gmail.com' -Port 587 -UseSsl -Credential $credential
    
                    # add to daily record 
                    [void]$spacFilings.Add($obj)
                    $n++
                } else {$n++}
                    
            } until (
                $n -ge $i
            )
        }       
    }

Check your email and there should be five alerts!

If you run the above code block again, no alerts because it checks the $accessionNumber hashset and sees that the filing has been emailed already.

SPACs,"""The Big Five"" Pre-DA Warrants","You've probably heard me talk a lot about the ""Big Five"" warrants in the daily discussions. Since I've only vaguely mentioned the tickers when questioned, I figured it might be more helpful to explain why these particular five are big, and why you should consider adding them to your portfolio. To start, I would like to mention that these are all SPACs targeting companies in the energy/mining sector which is by far the most lucrative industry to target in relation to warrant values both pre and post merger. Hopefully you already have or will consider getting these around 10 cents when they fall into that range every once in awhile. Good luck! :)

&#x200B;

**$RRAC (Rigel Resources Acquisition Corp \[**[**https://www.rigelresource.com/**](https://www.rigelresource.com/)**\], 1/2 unit split warrants, $306m trust w/ extension vote coming):**

This is a pretty stacked team looking for a target in the critical metals industry, specifically with the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (think ""energy transition""). Their team includes the founder of Orion Resource Partners which invests billions in mining companies, a Deutsche Bank metals & mining division employee (and investment officer at Orion), another investment/acquisition manager, a multi-decade Goldman Sachs global commodities investor, and so many more. You can check out their investment team on their website if you would like to take a deeper dive. In the last week, prior to their extension vote on August 7th, they announced that they've had an LOI with a global metals company since March. Extension is pretty large compared to recent others, extending all the way out to August 2024. We shall see where it goes!

&#x200B;

**$RFCA (RCF Acquisition Corp \[**[**https://rcfacquisitioncorp.com/**](https://rcfacquisitioncorp.com/)**\], 1/2 unit split warrants, $136m trust drawn down from $248m originally):**

Another team targeting the critical minerals industry with a focus on the renewables and/or energy transition angle. The sponsor, RCF has invested in over 200 critical minerals companies, so it's fair to say they know what they're looking for. The chairman of the SPAC is the co-founder of the sponsor itself which lends a bit more credibility to the team, and the rest of the members aren't slackers neither. They have people executives from BHP Minerals, BP, Rothschild, and Goldman Sachs, with almost all positions specifically relating to metals/mining. They took a roughly 50% hit on their trust with the most recent extension but that still leaves wayyyyy more money in the bank than most SPACs do when they extend. They have had an undisclosed LOI since March as well and have until May of 2024 to get it done.

&#x200B;

**$BMAC (Black Mountain Acquisition Corp \[**[**https://www.blackmountainaq.com/**](https://www.blackmountainaq.com/)**\], 3/4 unit split warrants, $51m trust drawn down from $125m originally):**

These guys are looking for a target in the energy industry as a whole. Their team pretty much consists of Black Mountain Resources leadership. There's been a lot of second-hand knowledge I've come across from others that point to a DA in the near future (ex. recently formed ""fourty8capital"" company having a ""coming soon"" board member image that is a 1-1 carbon copy image of Rhett Bennett who is the CEO of both Black Mountain Resources and $BMAC) but I can't be completely sure so I won't be focusing on speculation. This is one of two of the ""Big Five"" that don't have an active LOI. Looks like currently they are giving themselves until December 18th, 2023 to get a deal done.

&#x200B;

**$PHYT (Pyrophyte Acquisition Corp \[**[**https://pyrophytespac.com/**](https://pyrophytespac.com/)**\], 1/2 unit split warrants, $94m trust drawn down from $150m originally):**

Again, another SPAC looking for a target in the energy transition ecosystem. This one is not specific to metals or commodities though so in case their current ""critical minerals"" undisclosed LOI, which was announced this past April, falls through, they have a lot of other options. Their small team is comprised of Bernard Duroc (founder of Weatherford International, Grant Prideco, and EVI), Sten Gustafson (energy sector investor and executive who advised 200+ equity transactions), Bryan Hassin (energy company startup investor), Alex Carsner (director at Exxon and Applied Materials), and Per Pederson (held many executive positions at wind turbine companies). There's a few more less noteworthy members as well. They have extended their deadline to April 29th, 2024.

&#x200B;

**$BFAC (Battery Future Acquisition Corp \[**[**https://www.futureacquisition.com/**](https://www.futureacquisition.com/)**\], 1/2 unit split warrants, $120m trust drawn down from $369m originally):**

This is a bit different from the others as they are looking for an energy target but specifically in the battery-related industry, hence the name. They are the other ""Big Five"" member without an LOI. They have a diverse team of metals & mining professionals all the way from acquisition/investment executive, to mining project leads, to chemical engineers. After their somewhat recent extension vote, it appears that they have until June 17th, 2024 to make a deal.

&#x200B;

SPACs,The Great Edtechx debauchery,"Edtechx holdings acquisition corp went from $10 a share to $60 a share over the course of a few days in July this year. The stock became your typical low float SPAC play. The company was set to merge with a company called ZSpace but recently terminated that merger. They currently have a date in December for expiration/redemption date so they more than likely will liquidate. The company has been behind on filing their quarterly reports and is in non compliance with Nasdaq. 

The SPAC is currently halted and and has been for several months. Several shorts are stuck as shares have exploded to $60. Longs are also stuck with no way to sell shares. I'd expect shares to collapse upon reopening but I've been wrong before. 

Anyone care to give any detail on this unique spac situation?

# Setup PowerShell 

We are building a script. This particular file will execute code on your machine. The machine first needs to be given permission to run scripts.

Open PowerShell as administrator, you can do this one of two ways:

1. Right click the Start Menu, click *Windows PowerShell (Admin),* approve the User Account Control when prompted
2. Find the Windows PowerShell icon or use the search to look for it. Right click and select  *Run as Administrator*

At the console, type:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Approve the change:

    PS C:\> set-executionpolicy remotesigned
    
    Execution Policy Change
    The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
    you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
    https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?

&#x200B;

# Prepare for Script

Open Notepad and create a list of tickers. Save it in a new folder (e.g. c:\\temp), with any name as long as it ends in .csv.

Right click the blank space inside the folder and *New > Text Document*. Name this document *Get-SECNotifications.ps1*. PS1 is a PowerShell File.

Here's what my folder looks like:

&#x200B;

[CSV and PS1 files in the c:\\temp folder](https://preview.redd.it/dlpe2saubxgb1.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=f261061a6bd505fd630a0245c3fe5175949d0d36)

Double click *Get-SECNotifications.ps1* and it will open a blank document in notepad. Alternatively, right click the PS1 select *Edit*, this will open the PowerShell ISE, a script editor of sorts.

&#x200B;

# Changes from Parts 1 and 2

* We are eliminating the $folder variable, where the CSV of tickers is stored. If we run the script from the same folder the CSV is in, our script will check the folder it runs from by using the environmental variable, $PSScriptRoot. As long as there is only one CSV, we're good.
* We have a new variable, $ErrorActionPreference. Since our script is set to loop all day, this tells the script to stop if it encounters an error.
* We're adding the cmdlet *Start-Transcript*, this will track any errors via a log file, stored in $PSScriptRoot AKA the folder you run the script from.
* Variables $toEmail and $fromEmail have been changed to $to and $from
* $to, $from, and $appPassword are now *parameters* (see further down) 

&#x200B;

# Script Objectives

Thinking through it, our script will:

* Start the function 
* Get to, from, app password from the script runner (you) as parameters
* Begin the function's command
   * load all variables we need that will not be created or recreated in any of our loops. Foreach, if/then, do/until are examples of loops.
   * Start a transcript
* Process the work our script's function does
   * Import tickers
   * Use the ticker to find its corresponding CIK
      * create a 10-digit CIK
      * Add CIK to a hashset (fancy list)
   * Only check for filing if submission window is open
      * Check each CIK individually to see if there are filings dated TODAY / space requests to 10 per second
      * Proceed only if filings from today is TRUE
      * determine number of filings with today's date
      * collect filings 0 though i, until i and n are equal, then move on to the next CIK
      * check existing SPAC filings to see if their accession number was already checked today
      * enumerate recent filings only from the response
      * create an object with the data we need to email an alert
      * create the email subject and body
      * send the email
      * add the found SPAC filing to the hashset that keeps track of today's filings the script has looked at
      * increase n by 1
      * if the filing has been checked, increase n by 1
      * if n is greater or equal to the number of filings, stop checking filings
      * move onto the next CIK until there are none left in the hashset
      * Recheck date
   * using the new date, if we are still in the filing window check again, if not, end script processing
* End the commands in script's function

# Parts of the Script

**Hashes**

When you see hashes (#) these are notes to clarify my thought process. The computer ignores anything that's ""hashed out.""

&#x200B;

**Function**

All the instructions the computer needs to do when running the script are encased in a *function*. The function will look like:

    function Get-SECNotifications {
        # all instructions are contained within
    }

&#x200B;

**Parameters**

These will change depending on who is using the script (because we have different emails as passwords). The parameters will be saved as variables. This part makes sure we don't continue without this info.

    param (
        [CmdletBinding()]
    
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$to,
    
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$from,
    
        [parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$appPassword
    )

&#x200B;

**Begin**

    begin {
        # variables loaded here
        # transcript started
    }

&#x200B;

**Process**

    process {
        # heavy lifting goes here
    }

Within the process we have the section of code that checks to see if the time is between 6AM EST and 10PM EST and if it is, check our tickers for filings. This is called a *while*, as in, while this is true (the time window), if there are filings from today (filings from today = true), do that (check each ticker CIK), until we have our filings (no more from today).

**While; if; foreach; do until**

    while ( ) {
        foreach ( ) {
            if ( ) {
                do {
    
                } until ( ) 
            }
        }
    }

&#x200B;

**End**

Any tidying up goes here (sometimes nothing):

    end {
        #tidy up
    }

&#x200B;

# Instruct the Script to Run our Function

After the last curly brace "" } "" closes our function, we instruct the script it to run the function by typing its name along with our parameters. This is the last line of the script. *You must fill in your own to, from, and app password or this will not work:*

    Get-SECNotifications -to toemail@address.com -from fromemail@address.com -appPassword abcdefghijklmnop

&#x200B;

# Completed Script

What the final product looks like / what you should have in your Get-SECNotifications.ps1 file:

    function Get-SECNotifications {
    
        <#
            .SYNOPSIS
                This will first check for a CSV of tickers in the folder where the script is stored. Then it will check each ticker's filings. If it finds some from today then it will alert you by email.
    
            .EXAMPLE
                Get-SECNotifications -toEmail <address@provider.com> -fromEmail <emailaddress@gmail.com> -appPassword <abcdefghijlmnopq>
    
                Be sure to swap these out with your own information, see the last line of the script.
    
            .PARAMETER to
                This is the email address that would like to receive alerts. It can be same or different than the from email.
    
            .PARAMETER from
                This is the email address that needs to login and send the email with the alert information in the subect and body. In the examples I have used GMail.
    
            .PARAMETER appPassword
                This is the app password that should be created ahead of time. App passwords bypass interactive sign-ins and do not require MFA.

# Test the Script

Open the folder where your CSV and PS1 files are.

Right click *Get-SECNotifications.ps1* and select *Run with PowerShell*.

A blank console box will appear. This is your script actively running in the foreground. If you don't X out of it to close, it should in theory run until 10PM EST, when it will exit and close the console box on its own. If the tickers in your list have filings from today, you should be emailed once for each one.

&#x200B;

# Automating the Script

Open *Task Scheduler* as administrator. Select *create task* in actions pane on the right hand side.

General tab:

* Name: Get SEC Alerts
* Choose, *run whether user is logged on or not*
* Tick the box, *run with highest privileges*

Triggers tab:

* New...
   * Begin the task: On a schedule
   * Choose, *daily*
      * Start: pick a date | pick a time e.g. 5:59 AM (if you are on EST)
      * Recur every: 1 day
   * OK

Actions Tab: 

* New...
   * Action: Start a program
   * Program/script: PowerShell.exe
   * Add arguments: -ExecutionPolicy Bypass C:\\temp\\Get-SECNotifications.ps1

&#x200B;

Click OK, enter your computer Admin password if prompted.

&#x200B;

Now, everyday at 5:59AM, your script will run until the filing window is closed at 10PM EST, emailing you along the way.

Here's a company whose trailing financials appear utterly atrocious, but with a look at the pro-forma business(es), and their various assets, this restructuring undergoing an asset-light strategic shift may offer an opportunity.

Some of you may know me due to my investment in GameStop (GME) in the pursuit of value. After being invested for over three years I published a research report in January 2021 (GMEdd.com) as the culmination of my, and others, collective due diligence, and even got to participate in a documentary that talked about the crowdsourced research & DD internet friends I made amid Covid conducted on the Roaring Kitty YouTube streams & across social media: [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gamestop\_rise\_of\_the\_players](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gamestop_rise_of_the_players). 

I now work at a private investment fund ([http://wookcapital.com/about-us/](http://wookcapital.com/about-us/)) that was created out of life changing profits realized amid the subsequent exit from GME. I hadn't published a report like GMEdd since then, until last Sunday when we published [PLBYdd.com](http://PLBYdd.com). Our **bear, base, and bull scenarios pencil out to $3.05, $5.34, and $11.11**, respectively, relative to today's closing price of $1.93.

As I disclose quarterly my personal account's positions on my Twitter, PLBY became the largest position in my personal account after significantly raising the position size during 2Q23: [https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1674950573848666112?s=20](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1674950573848666112?s=20). 

I've been an investor there since shortly after the February 2021 de-SPAC transaction, and have been calling for CEO Ben Kohn's resignation publicly since August 2022: [https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1562179675325079553?s=20](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1562179675325079553?s=20). I am prepared to personally oppose his board seat in 2024 if there is not a material change in trajectory over the coming months.

I encourage you to review the \~2 hour report review + Q&A from last week (links available here: [https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1685730145389236225?s=20](https://twitter.com/RodAlzmann/status/1685730145389236225?s=20)) and I am happy to answer further questions here, to the extent that I am able.

ValueInvesting,How To Be a Successful Deep Value Investor (some tips I've learned),"Over the past few months, I have been studying various deep value investing strategies with the goal of trying to determine a set of rules or principles to follow when investing in deep value stocks to increase the likelihood of success.  
  
I‚Äôve seen at least a few posts on this subreddit on the topic of deep value investing which tells me people are interested in this topic. So here‚Äôs some of the key lessons I learned on how to identify both good and bad deep value stocks.  
  
Essentially what I did was run backtests to generate lists of deep value stocks from 5 years ago and 2 years ago. I ran these lists multiple times over the past few months, which gave me a list of about 50 deep value stocks from the past to analyze/draw insights from. Then I looked at what their returns were from either 5 years ago or 2 years ago to the present to break out the winners from the losers.   
  
After that, I looked into every deep value stock to understand the following:

  
1. Were they actually a deep value stock? (since we are primarily dealing with micro-caps, data errors in 3rd party websites is common, so always validate by looking at financial filings to ensure the company is actually a deep value stock)

  
2. Was this a company I can understand? As with any investing, it‚Äôs important to not invest in a company you can‚Äôt understand.

  
3. What is the makeup of NCAV? (I.e., the split between cash, receivables and inventory) This was a good check because some companies ended up in my backtests as net nets because of an accounting technicality. Like a company that reclassified a high value piece of real estate or equipment as ‚Äúheld for sale‚Äù which makes it a current asset instead of a non-current asset for a small period of time.

  
4. Does the company sell commoditized products? More on this later.

  
5. Why was it a deep value stock? The purpose of this was to understand what risk the company had that was scaring investors away and thus causing it to be a deep value stock.  


6. How did the stock perform over the next 2-5 years and what catalyzed those returns? Whether they were positive or negative returns, and what the reason was behind it was. This helped me understand the common reasons for why deep value stocks did well or not so well.  
  
My starting point for ‚Äúdeep value‚Äù stocks was to use Benjamin Graham‚Äôs net net method where NCAV must exceed market cap. (NCAV = net current asset value, which current assets less total liabilities). I also excluded certain industries that skewed the data such as biotech, real estate development companies, financial services businesses, and asset management firms. A lot of the time companies from these industries would appear as deep value stocks but aren‚Äôt really deep value once you understand them.   
  
For example, biotechs would be burning cash extremely fast so the only reason they appear as net net stocks is because they haven‚Äôt reported their quarterly results yet, and investors are anticipating their current assets to be diminished (this is pretty common outside of biotechs too). Real estate developers would have 99% of their ‚Äúcurrent assets‚Äù in land inventory that may have lost value, asset managers were essentially holding companies and so the ‚Äúholding company discount‚Äù was making them appear as net nets, etc.  
  
NCAV is meant to be a conservative estimate of a company‚Äôs liquidation value. So we‚Äôre looking for companies worth less than liquidation value, which in theory provides us with a margin of safety.  


  
**Lesson #1: Avoid companies with a single shareholder that has majority control.**  
This is the kind of thing that can blow up an entire investment. Remember that the logic behind investing in companies below liquidation value is that even if they have to liquidate, you still won‚Äôt lose much (if any at all). However if a company is controlled by a single shareholder that refuses to change the board of directors, refuses to approve any dividends, or make changes to the business at all (let alone liquidate the business) then your margin of safety is ultimately useless.   
An example of this is a company called Emerson Radio, which was a net net stock in 2018 and has gone down \~60% over the past 5 years.  They have about 72% of their voting shares controlled by Nimble Holdings which is a Hong Kong-based holding company. Over the years there have been several attempts from activist value investors to get Emerson to pay a special dividend of $1/share since the cash is sitting idle on the balance sheet, which have ultimately failed.  
Emerson Radio‚Äôs current assets were essentially entirely cash. And in 2018 they weren‚Äôt profitable, but were not losing very much money. NCAV was $40M and the market cap was about $33M, so plenty of margin of safety.  
But over the years, sales gradually declined and the stock went down a lot as Nimble refused to do anything to change the business or liquidate it, all the while management was paying themselves excessive salaries. It‚Äôs not that uncommon for deep value stocks to have management teams that are actively screwing over shareholders.

**Lesson #2: Avoid companies with shady management teams**  
  
This one may seem obvious, but remember there‚Äôs always a reason why a stock has become a deep value stock, and when you‚Äôre in the deep value investing mindset, it can be easy to ignore or discount the types of risks that are scaring away most investors.  
  
An example of this is a company called Amira Nature Foods, a formerly NYSE-listed Indian basmati rice wholesaler. This company was hit by several short seller reports accusing the management team of overstating their revenue as well as misappropriation of assets, and while the claims were initially refuted, the company ended up going to zero and was delisted for failure to publish their financial filings (their last financial filing was over 3 years ago).   
  
There‚Äôs a lot more to this story, but in short, if you have any doubts about management‚Äôs integrity, and you see related party transactions that don‚Äôt seem to make sense, I would avoid.  
  
**Lesson #3: Companies that sell commoditized products (oil, gold, etc.) can have stellar returns if their asset base has not been sold off/diminished**  
  
These two things together often made for deep value stocks having great returns (+20/30% annualized over 5 years), and I think it is logical when you break it down.   
  
Companies that sell commoditized products, or products that can fluctuate in price very rapidly, can have a massive turnaround very quickly. There were numerous examples of this, such as oil companies that were priced for failure, but then had a turnaround when oil prices went up in early 2022. Or steel companies that had a turnaround when Steel prices went up in 2021.   
  
Even if these rapid price increases are just temporary, one good year can be enough to make a deep value investment a success. Think of scenarios where a small oil company has a $60M market cap, is losing about $5M/year, then oil prices go up and they turn a $20M profit in one year. That simple turnaround could be 100-200% upside.  
  
However, if a commodity-based company has sold off some of their income-producing assets (equipment, factories, land, etc.) then such a turnaround is not possible. Even if the prices of whatever commodity they sell increase very rapidly, if the company cannot produce/manufacture enough of that commodity because they sold their assets, then the upside is limited. Just a simple check of the balance sheet over the past couple of years can help you determine this.   
  
The one caveat to this strategy is that it requires some catalyst to occur to induce commodity prices to go up, which is obviously extremely difficult to predict. However, this highlights the essence of deep value investing, which is that there‚Äôs the potential for massive upside (it‚Äôs not guaranteed), and the downside risk is limited since you are investing below liquidation value (heads I win, tails I don‚Äôt lose much). So even if you can‚Äôt predict a future turnaround, you‚Äôre not going to get kicked in the teeth if one doesn‚Äôt happen.  
  
**Lesson #4: Margin of safety is extremely important**  
  
Another one that may come across as obvious and not very insightful. But I will explain further with an example.  
  
A company called O2Micro was a net net stock 5 years ago (NCAV of $54M vs market cap of about $45M). The margin of safety in this case would be the extent to which NCAV exceeds the market cap, which is $9M or 20% of the company‚Äôs market cap.   
  
Current assets for O2Micro were about 2/3rds cash and short term investments, with the remaining third in receivables and inventory. The company sells integrated circuits used in LCD and LED products to OEMs (these get used in products like monitors, LCD and LED televisions, notebook and tablet computers, low/zero emission vehicles, mobile phones, power tools, etc.)  
  
This stock is up about 170% over the past 5 years, which was mainly due to a turnaround in the business induced by the COVID lockdowns, which caused demand for electronics products to skyrocket, and so O2Micro benefitted massively. In 2018, they were doing about $15M in sales/quarter, and were consistently losing money. By 2021, they were doing about $25M in sales/quarter with 10%+ operating margins.   
  
Again, you may be thinking it was impossible to predict such a turnaround in this business 5 years ago because no one would have predicted that pandemic-induced lockdowns would cause a spike in demand for electronics. Which is true, but the difference is in deep value investing you‚Äôre buying the company below liquidation value, so even if no turnaround ever happens, you‚Äôre downside is limited because the stock can only go so low before an activist investor starts buying up shares to force management to pay a special dividend to realize some of the value, or liquidate the business.  
  
**Lesson #5: All of the above lessons are just general rules and not absolute truths**  
  
There are very few absolute truths in the world of investing. The risk reward trade-off is one of them that is well documented and seldom refuted. But in general, these lessons serve as guiding principles that help investors make better informed decisions.   
  
A perfect example of this is one company  I looked at called VOXX International Corp. They had very little margin of safety ($138M NCAV vs. $131M market cap). Their NCAV was about 20% cash and investments, 30% receivables, and 50% inventory. The business was burning cash and revenue was declining throughout 2018. They didn‚Äôt sell commoditized products (they sold automotive and consumer electronics, and biometrics products). But despite all of that they still went on to deliver approximately 18% annualized returns for 5 years, which I think most people would be happy with. What's even stranger is it seems that these returns just came from an expansion of valuation multiples and not an actual fundamental improvement in the business (their P/S ratio 5 years ago was about 0.3 and eventually went up to about 0.9).

  
Let me know what you guys think of these lessons, and if you have any you would like to add from your own personal experience.  


I also published this YouTube video discussing my findings from this study with some more detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T\_FqdqDY3Co&t=1058s  
","[""Hey man! Great post! I appreciate it. \n\nI recently got that book in the mail about NET NET stocks; the buffett way and I've been just looking through it and looking at some companies using the formula. \n\nI noticed a lot of people will get their NCAVPS by getting 2/3rds of the IV  I personally notice that a 50% margin of safety seems to work better and reduce risk; obviously. Just feel like if you're going to look at these companies you want what you want which is DEEP FUCKING VALUE. The cigar butt method definitely still works; just gotta do some real analysis on these companies. \n\nI call these companies my coffee can stocks; I have a ROTH IRA that I throw change and loose dollar bills into and these stocks fit perfectly for this.. \n\nI'm finishing grad school this week and plan on studying all august for a boards exam I have to sit for but I plan on doing a deep dive into the book once I have my schedule clear."", ' Most interesting. Thanks for Sharing.\n\nFirst example you cited is a Chinese linked company, second example is an Indian linked company, third example is Taiwanese linked company and last example has restatements in its history.\n\nTell you something about Asian-linked companies ( I am Asian), for every Nvidia type of ceo that thinks first about the business and making money for its shareholders,  there are more examples of public officers who think that the public company is theirs and they screw the shareholders.\n\nI was once a shareholder of a business venture in Asia where a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù agreed to quit his day job to run this full time with a salary, as well as being a equal shareholder. After a while, he began to resent having to report to other shareholders on the progress of the company, and he began to run it like his own, screwed all the other shareholders by diluting their shares.\n\nMaybe one way to avoid all issues is to not invest in companies that are microcaps that never seem to grow. And Avoid companies with restatements too! (Your lesson #2)\n\nI believe that in the modern context, NCAV companies are cheap for a reason but they aren‚Äôt hidden gems anymore. Unlike back in BennyG‚Äôs era where people didn‚Äôt have access to internet like we do now, and financial news were mostly concentrated on larger companies.', 'Add a couple of things.  Be aware of Israeli management teams.  They tend to be aggressive and can blow you up.  That said I have a saying about management is a bunch of scumbags and sometimes they‚Äôre my scumbag.   If they‚Äôre my scumbag you know they‚Äôre going to be promotional.  And as long as you know that ceo is going to run things up and it may or may not work - and better to take profits (or take some profits) and run and miss upside rather hold too long and hold the bag, then it‚Äôs not necessarily bad to invest.   \n\nLarge holders can be good or bad.  If it‚Äôs a corporate holder then the problem is there may not be alignment of interests.  If it‚Äôs a private equity firm or maybe a VC (or some financial holder), they have fund pressures that may not necessarily be bad to own stock alongside.   So have to look at exact situation rather than rule of thumb.   If VC or pe firm needs exit to raise next fund then they‚Äôre going to put pressure on management.  If not, then may or may not be good.  \n\nCommodities may or may not be bad depending on what you‚Äôre paying for the asset.  In addition, sometimes the best stocks are the ones everyone else thinks is a commodity that when you dig into business model is actually not a commodity.   Don‚Äôt just assume.  You‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised sometimes.  \n\nAnother thing to add for cigar butt investing.   What‚Äôs the catalyst.  What changes everyone‚Äôs viewpoint of the value of the company.   For deep value long investing and short selling, the catalyst is key.  It‚Äôs what gives you the big return you‚Äôre looking for.  What is everyone missing that‚Äôs interesting that changes the value of the company.   Having something cash flowing is preferable of course but sometimes the best deep value longs have debt, everyone has left company for dead but a catalyst will change the situation where the company no longer goes bankrupt.  The challenge with these kinds of situations is it requires a lot of understanding of credit and how debt holders / banks will react to situation.  One of the best deep value long guys I know was a workout credit analyst at a big bank.   Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find those kinds of situations without the skill set / experience but it doesn‚Äôt make things harder to figure out.  \n\nOther kind of deep value long is a really small market cap company that is actually cash flow positive and just growing.

ValueInvesting,FinanceCharts.com - Free resource for value investors,"[www.financecharts.com](https://www.financecharts.com)

Hello, I've created a free site that's geared more towards value investors than most of the other finance sites out there.  It's 100% free, no signups or anything.  I've never found a service that quite worked for my needs so I went ahead and created my own. I'm 100% certain every value investor will find this service to be extremely useful.

Why should you use it? 

\- 20 year charts on all financial metrics. Many sites just show the current value, I like to look at long-term charts to get some context.

\- It's super easy to compare multiple companies at once and each page shows peers so you can discover companies you weren't previously aware of.

\- It has a big focus on dividends and dividend metrics. I'm more of an income investor so I wanted to be able to go deep on dividends.

\- We have a custom screener, but we also have a ton of built-in screeners that will help you get new ideas (most profitable companies, dividend aristocrats, companies with most cash, etc.).

\- It's really really easy to use this site.  Some of the other sites out there are WAY too complicated IMO. You want depth but you also need to be able to digest it.

\- It's totally free.  I don't like paying fees on my investments and I don't want to pay for my research either.  Call me cheap I don't care.

If you like to do research check it out. It's honestly helped me to manage my investments. My decision making has improved quite a bit. I believe it will help you too.

ValueInvesting,"Charlie Munger calls EBITDA ""BS earnings."" Do you agree?","One value investing topic I'm really interested in is the different definitions of profit.

* Net income.
* EBIT.
* EPS.
* Adjusted EPS.
* Cash from operations.
* Free cash flow.
* And so on.

There are many different ways of looking at profit, each with its pros and cons. One of the most controversial is adjusted EBITDA. Charlie Munger famously called it 'BS earnings,' because it excludes so many costs that it's almost worthless. I actually [made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKUURX77pks) about this recently, where I went over all the different things that are excluded from EBITDA--turns out, it excludes quite a bit!

With that in mind, what do you think about adjusted EBITDA? Is it always 'BS'? Is it useful if companies are careful about how they calculate it? What about companies that still in the early, growth stage--is it suitable as a measure of how **close** they are to profitability?

Really interested in hearing your opinion!","[""EBITDA measures a company's ability to service debt costs. It is not a measurement of  economic returns. Once you understand that, it has its place like most financial metrics.\n\nThe best measurement of economic returns is NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) minus CapEx. Then divide by total invested capital for a solid ROIC measure. NOPAT is pretty straight forward for most industries. Google it."", 'EBITDA for manufacturing companies is like adjusted operating profit for software companies. Highly capital intensive manufacturing companies get to add back depreciation and software companies add back all the stock based comp.\n\nDepreciation matters more to me because the assets will need to be replaced at the end of their life hurting cash flow. Stock based comp lowers the value of shares but these software companies generate so much free cash flow that they can buy back shares to keep their share count flat. So when I value software companies I often use adjusted operating income per share. In my opinion It doesn‚Äôt make sense to hurt the company with the cost and share count line.', ""100 agree and I'm an accountant"", ""I'm in the minority that believes EBITDA is a fine tool when used correctly. The reason for Munger's criticism is that if one looks only at EBITDA, and the business is highly CAPEX intensive or suffers from persistent high working capital expansion, that's very different from a business that requires little or no CAPEX. The correction for this is spelled out in the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report, in which they define Owner's Earnings. Speaking in broad strokes, the key difference Buffett and Munger highlight there is that they effectively start with EBITDA but then subtract normalized CAPEX that's necessary to keep the business' competitive strength steady relative to peers. \n\nJust imagine a moat-less business where all earnings have to be put back into the business just to keep up with the competition. A good example of this is, well, Berkshire Hathaway itself, originally. The textile business suffered brutally from a constant need to buy newer, better equipment (among other things) that effectively made all the capital they had put into the old equipment worthless. The old textile machines couldn't be sold at anything close to a reasonable price since everyone else was upgrading alongside Berkshire and Berkshire couldn't keep them in service or the product quality would suffer to the point of being uncompetitive. The business could prop itself up relatively well but CAPEX adjusted Owner's Earnings were *dreadful*. \n\nOn the other hand, Berkshire's Sees Candy is a great example of a deep moat business. EBITDA grows with little CAPEX or working capital investment, and the business just gushes cash as a result.\r  \n\r  \nSo, this brings us back to why I think EBITDA can be an excellent tool when analyzing a business, and the reason is that EBITDA does not require me to estimate anything and is free from the disadvantages of using actual historical FCF. Historical FCF is fraught with peril, generally speaking, and one should be wary of anyone who only uses actual FCF in their thesis construction imo because FCF by itself suffers from all sorts of quirks. To illustrate just one such quirk, suppose one company grows with abnormally high CAPEX one year, while another grows just as much, but by e.g. buying a factory instead of building it? FCF in the first case will be highly suppressed compared to the second, even though they are economically equivalent. \r  \n\r  \nUsing historical FCF requires careful estimates to normalize it and this too is often emphasized in Berkshire's annual reports, but historical EBITDA does not require anyone to rely on my normalization estimates. Depending on the business being discussed (and I am the first to admit not all businesses are suited to being described in terms of EBITDA), I can make my point pretty effectively using historical EBITDA without introducing the human error baked into a normalized historical FCF figure or, even worse, an actual FCF figure with no thought given to how accurately it actually reflects the strength of the underlying business.\n\nPowerful historical EBITDA growth CAGR is what it is. Massive growth fueled by organic drivers, M&A, share repurchases or any combination of the three will all print out a nice chart of rising EBITDA. Now, the conversation cannot stop there because how a business printed that lovely EBITDA chart still matters, which is another danger Munger rightfully harps on. A company that only managed to print that EBITDA chart by trashing their balance sheet is obviously a much worse investment than one that adeptly achieved it while remaining leverage neutral or even deleveraging itself if the C-suite are true all-stars. \r  \n\r  \nThere is one other reason EBITDA is important in a more general sense and I believe another commenter touched on this already. Lenders use EBITDA to define leverage, and for companies that borrow, and have debt covenants, it's extremely important for this reason alone.\n\nTLDR: Munger's criticisms about EBITDA are justified but EBITDA can still be useful when used correctly."", 'Yes', 'Of course', 'EBITDA is useful but not as a measure of profit.\n\nIt‚Äôs more useful as an input to an adjusted ROC calculation, as it allows you to compare across companies agnostic to how they‚Äôre capitalised.\n\nYes it excludes a lot of costs, but it doesn‚Äôt follow that you should buy unprofitable companies.', 'Really enjoyed reading the question and comments thanks everyone üôè', 'EBITDA means ""Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization"". Excluding amortization, the other items are real economic expenses. For avoidance of doubt, the main controversy lie in the usage of EBITD than EBITDA - we can ignore amortization as an issue as it is not real economic expense.\n\nNext, EBITD or EBITDA by itself should not be viewed as contentious. It can still be a useful metric if you know when and how to best use it, or how to best adjust it for better comparability comparison. There is an insightful response to this by u/Perpetual5YOld.\n\nFrom the context of why Charlie Munger calls EBITDA ""BS earnings"", we have to look at it from the perspective of how EBITD (or EBITDA) is being communicated to investors by companies (particularly those with less stellar performance). Assuming if two companies have the same EBITD (or EBITDA) but different tax expenses, interest expenses, and CAPEX (with all other things being equal, for e.g., growth), investors may mistaken view them as equal due to how companies present such information.\n\nIn other words, less attractive companies can drum up their financial performance with EBITD (or EBITDA) and investors may be misled into paying a higher price-to-earnings. This is because the financial performance metric based on EBITD (or EBITDA) tend to put companies with higher tax expenses, interest expenses, and CAPEX in a better light. Had these investors considered all the facts of these same companies properly, the intrinsic valuation of these less attractive companies would have been lower.', ""EBITDA itself is not bullshit. But if you see a quarterly earnings report that mentions how great their EBITDA was, then ask yourself why they aren't showing off their net profit. If their earnings were eaten up by paying too much in interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization (the ITDA in EBITDA) they hide that fact by flaunting EBITDA instead of profit.""]"

ValueInvesting,Is oil good now?,"In the chapter ""The Perfect Stock"" of his book ""One Up On Wall Street"" Peter Lynch describes the qualities of the businesses that he likes to invest in. His argument goes that businesses having many of these qualities are more likely to be undervalued by the market and therefore to be good candidates for investment.

In this post I'd like to evaluate the oil industry as a whole against Lynch's criteria and see if maybe oil today isn't the perfect Lynchean business. So, here we go. References at the bottom. Number one...

(1) It sounds dull - or, even better, ridiculous

As little as 10 years ago, oil was hot. 18 years ago Exxon was the largest company in the world by market capitalization[7]. Schwarzenegger drove a Hummer.

Today, the oil industry is talked about as a part of the old economy, the legacy economy, etc., together with plastic, paper and car manufacturers, fossil fuel and nuclear power plants, mining, steel mills, etc. Who would want to invest in the dull, old economy, when they can invest in the smart, new economy. It hasn't reached ridicule yet, but it's getting there. +1 Lynch point.

(2) It does something dull

The oil industry produces fuel for transportation, power generation, heating, as well as feedstocks for the chemical industry, lubricants and plastics. It's not as dull, as, say, a paper mill, but it's not as exciting as AI or Bitcoin. +1 Lynch point, but Lynch would probably give it half a point.

(3) It does something disagreeable

Oh boy, does it. Together with thermal coal, oil is public enemy number one today. The best way to experience the vitriol, I think, is to watch a recent interview with the CEO of Chevron, Mike Wirth, that took place at the Aspen Ideas Festival 2023 (link below). CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin was the interviewer. One of the first questions lobbed at Mike was ""There are a lot of people in this room and around the world who are desperate ... to want to really end fossil fuels ... They think that oil is the equivalent of cigarettes, it's a terrible thing for the world... How do you reconcile that?[1]""

Just, wow. The entire interview was full of tough questions like that. Compare that to the interview with the CEO of GM, Mary Barra, same venue, where all of the questions that she got were a variation on ""How do you manage to be such an amazing, flawless, impeccable, perfect person and CEO?[3]"". For context, GM had previously announced that they will stop producing fossil fuel-powered cars by 2035[8]. +1 Lynch point.

(4) It's a spinoff

This point doesn't apply to industries as a whole though, so we'll skip this one.

(5) The institutions don't own it, and the analysts don't follow it

Multiple institutions have announced plans to divest themselves of fossil fuel stocks. It seems to have started somewhere around 2011, when activist students began pressuring their universities and their endowment funds[9]. The divestment movement has since spread to other institutions, culminating in Norway's sovereign fund announcing that they will divest all companies dedicated solely to oil and gas exploration[2]. The irony here is that Norway's entire fund was built off of her oil exports and now it's shunning the industry that gave birth to it. +1 Lynch point just for this.

ESG investment and ESG ETF's have gained a lot of popularity as well, with the assumption being that these funds invest in what's good for the environment (they're not) and that therefore they don't invest in oil companies (they do). Specifics aside, it's the perception that matters.

Plenty of analysts are following the industry, but none of them are household names. You've heard of Cathie Wood, you've heard of Chamath. You probably have never heard of Paul Sankey.

(6) The rumors abound: It's involved with toxic waste and/or the mafia.

Oil spills, wars in the Middle East, military coups in Central and South America, the list goes on. The industry has a long history of being involved in shady stuff. +1 Lynch point.

(7) There's something depressing about it

""How dare you?"". Global warming, climate change, forest fires, draughts and hurricanes. In Germany, there's the activist group called ""the last generation"" that glue themselves onto the asphalt on the streets to prevent cars from passing. The thinking is that if not we, then our children will die in a fireball of global warming and there's nothing we can do about it except cry. It's a depressing thought. +1 Lynch point.

(8) It's a no-growth industry

No-growth industries don't attract competition. To paraphrase Peter Lynch, the graduating class at Wharton isn't going to challenge the incumbents in oil and you can't tell your friends in investment banking that you've decided to specialize in fossil fuels.

IEA, the global cheerleader of renewable energy and foremost climate change fighter, projects that oil demand globally will grow by about 1% per year until 2028[4]. That's when demand is also projected to peak. The market knows that, the oil companies know that. They're not going to invest in new production capacity, they're not going to invest in growth. They're going to milk the existing assets for all they're worth and return the cash to shareholders.

And that's the worst case for oil. It requires that the energy transition goes perfectly, that we do, indeed, decarbonize until 2050. In this sense, the energy transition is priced to perfection. There is a non-trivial likelihood that oil lives on longer than that, and today you can get that optionality for free. At the very least, it's not obvious that we can mine all of the metals and minerals necessary for the transition in time[5]. Then, beyond the minerals, many of the suggested solutions are half-baked and would not work in the real world. When Warrenn Buffett was asked why he started building a position in OXY, he basically said ""it's physics versus demagogues""[10]. Guess who will win. On a related note, in the same video Charlie Munger mentions that ""admitting you're buying coal is like going out and seeking to acquire cancer - you can't even borrow to expand a coal mine, it got very unfashionable"". Coal might be even more Lynchean than oil. +1 Lynch point, at any rate.

(9) It's got a niche

For better or worse, oil in today's world is irreplaceable. Compared to today's best battery technology, gasoline and diesel are 30 times more energy dense. Unless battery technology drastically improves, there will always be transportation use cases that can only be served by oil (long-distance air travel comes to mind). Plastics are irreplaceable - for all their faults, they're cheap, light, durable and versatile. +1 Lynch point.

By the way, all of the above use cases can be completely replaced by biofuels (SAF, sustainable aviation fuel, is a thing) and circular plastics/biological plastics (e.g. Circulen). But crude oil-derived plastics will likely continue to be the cheapest option for a long time and sometimes the price is all that matters.

(10) People have to keep buying it

As part of his platform Biden threatened that he will end the oil industry with his mighty fist. But then push came to shove - Russia invaded in Ukraine, and gas prices in the US went sky-high. What did he do? Did he gleefully herald the new era of expensive gas as the perfect opportunity to transition to EVs and renewable energy sources?

Nope, he meeped to the Saudis to produce more oil, meeped at oil companies to start drilling and stop share buybacks and released half of the US strategic petroleum reserve to alleviate price pressures. Analysts estimate that the SPR will never ever again be refilled to the same level.

Oil demand is, in fact, very inelastic[11]. This means that whenever oil prices go up, consumption barely increases, and when oil prices go down, consumption barely decreases. People need energy to do what they need to do, and they'll pay for it (at least in the short term). And if they can't get it right away, they'll vote someone in, who can give it to them. +1 Lynch point.

(11) It's a user of technology

The oil industry is a modest beneficiary of technology. Modern software for designing refineries is pretty good. C3.ai made the news some time ago that their AI tech had helped LyondellBasell optimize a refinery to get x% more out of it.
AI is a pretty good foundational technology. There was a recent paper that showed that AI can predict what a person is typing just by the sound of their keyboard coming over Zoom[12]. So it's likely to be useful in oil exploration, I imagine. There is a lot of research in predictive maintenance using AI models for detecting the early signs of upcoming failure. The magnitude of the benefits is arguable in the grand scheme of things, so, let's say half a Lynch point.

(12) The insiders are buyers

Haven't researched this. I wouldn't be surprised if there was zero insider buying outside some Texan cabal. It's very toxic to associate your brand with oil these days, but if you're working in oil, you might as well go all the way way. 0 Lynch points, but could be higher.

(13) The company is buying back its shares

Yes. A lot. All of them. Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC) is the A-student here, having decreased its shares outstanding by 35% between June 2021 and June 2023. At this rate in 4 more years they will have returned 100% of capital to shareholders and the rest is free optionality. +1 Lynch point.

Somewhere in 2019 oil companies collectively switched from a growth at all costs mentality to a ROIC mentality. Some of them strayed into industries outside their area of competence, e.g. BP and EV charging stations, but by and large, companies and CEOs are committed to not waste money on growth at all costs that plagued the industry for most of last decade. Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum (OXY, Buffett darling) explained as much in a keynote[6] on the modern thinking of oil co CEO's.

It's important that companies do buybacks when they're undervalued, otherwise size of the pie that remains for the rest of the shareholders will be smaller after the buyback. You'd basically get a repeat of BBBY. And you don't want a repeat of BBBY. At 8 times earnings, the XLE is cheap relative to the S&P 500. Some might say that cyclicals look cheapest at the peak of the cycle. It's a judgment call, of course, if we really are at a cyclical peak, and superior judgment will produce superior returns. Time will tell.

---
Summary.

10.5/12 Lynch points (we don't count the spin-off rule). Wow, that's a pretty Lynchy industry, wouldn't you say? This makes it very likely to be undervalued. Therefore investment in oil is likely to produce superior risk-adjusted returns given today's sentiment.

This, of course, is only the first step of deciding what to buy concretely. Next comes the homework - you'd look at annual reports and balance sheets and all that. But you'll do your homework with the understanding that you're about to make some serious money. Thanks for reading üòä

There has been a giant ""defund"" oil & gas companies movement the last 15-years or so, so a lot of institutional capital like university endowments, pension funds, ESG funds, etc. are not investing.

ValueInvesting,A low price-to-book ratio doesn't mean a company is cheap - Here's why,"Once in a while, I get a message or an email, with a certain company name that has a price/book ratio below 1, and the question at the end is ""What am I missing"" or ""Does this make sense""?

As always, a video for those who prefer to watch: https://youtu.be/F2Bx7iKMpAM

The goal of this post is to elaborate on why a low price-to-book ratio doesn't necessarily mean a company is cheap. The post is divided into the following segments:

\- The theory

\- Example - Big Lots

\- Going concern

\- Conclusion

&#x200B;

**The theory**

The theory is quite simple. If a company has a price-to-book ratio of 1, the market price is in line with the book value of the company.

If the ratio is below 1, you can buy the **book** **value** of the company for a lower price. Should you buy a company with such a ratio, you get more than what you pay for **(in accounting terms).** 

On the other side, if the ratio is above 1, you'll be paying a premium compared to the **book value**.

I've bolded a couple of words, and that's where the catch is.

&#x200B;

**Example - Big Lots**

Although the theory is simple, the practice is not so much.

Let me introduce you to Big Lots, a furniture & home decor retailer.

Its market cap is roughly $210m. Let's assume that you have the option to buy the entire company for $250 (a premium is often paid for a transaction of this type). **This is the price**.

If you take a look at the book value (which is **total assets minus total liabilities**), that is equal to $550 million! **This is the book value.**

Based on these two numbers, we can calculate a price-to-book ratio of 0.45.

So, can you not buy the entire business for $250, sell all the assets, pay all the liabilities, and collect the remaining $550? In this case, we **assume that the book value is equal to the liquidation value.**

&#x200B;

*Imagine that you've done this. You've paid $250 million and now you own Big Lots. Now what?*

Let's see what that would look like in practice: Big Lots has total assets of $3.66 billion and total liabilities of $3.11 billion.

The 3 big buckets when it comes to assets are:

\- $1.1 billion of inventories

\- $1.5 billion of operating leases (Right-of-use assets)

\- $750 million of property, plant, and equipment

This explains over 90% of all the assets. So, how can this be converted into cash, so the liabilities can be settled, and you are left with $550 million?

***Inventories*** 

How can one get rid of $1.1 billion of inventories? There are two main ways:

1. As this is a retail company, you can choose to sell them through regular business operations. The catch? The company is not profitable. Over the last quarter, it sold $730m of inventories for $1.1 billion in net sales and reported a net loss above $200m. To sell $1.1 billion of inventories, it would take around 5 months, and it is quite clear that the outcome will not be $1.1 billion in cash, but closer to $700m (assuming the company losses $400m throughout these 5 months). But imagine what this would look like. You have all the stores with 100% inventory, then 80% inventory, then 50% inventory, then 20% inventory. It is unlikely that the inventory will go down to 0 unless special discounts are offered. Which means the $700m mentioned above, might be an overstatement.
2. You could call a competitor, and offer them the inventory. You'll likely hear a positive answer and an offer of $500m or $600m. Wait, you might ask, isn't the book value $1.1 billion? How come the offer is so low? Big Lots paid $1.1 billion to the manufacturing companies, to buy the inventory and have it delivered to their stores/warehouses. The competitors can do exactly the same, for the same price. In addition, the competitors don't have to order $1.1 billion at once and tie a lot of their capital. They could order a lot less. Therefore, you, as the new owner of Big Lots, have no negotiation power.

Already, you can see that the **book value is not equal to the liquidation value.** This is only one of the three main assets of the business.

&#x200B;

***Operating leases (Right-of-use assets)***

The previous owners/managers of the business, have signed numerous leasing contracts (for properties, equipment, vehicles, etc.) and these assets provide value to Big Lots. Canceling these contracts would also remove the lease liability on the other side of the balance sheet.

So, this should be straightforward, right? Not really, no.

To expect that you can ring anyone, and cancel the contract ""as of tomorrow"" is unreasonable. 

There will either be a notice period or a cancellation fee/fine.

&#x200B;

***Property, plant and equipment***

At least this one should be easy, right? Well, I have some bad news.

Selling land & buildings in today's market might not be the most difficult task. But how about all the equipment and vehicles that the company owns? I'm referring to the small ones such as stalls and cash registers, all the way to their forklifts and delivery vehicles.

To get rid of them on short notice, you'd have to sell them at a discount.

&#x200B;

***What else is missing?***

This is not all. How about the employees? Liquidating a company of this size will not happen without severance pays.  

&#x200B;

**Going concern**

So, why do we have those book values if they don't represent the liquidation value? Because there is something called **""going concern""**. It is a fundamental assumption, that the company (in this case Big Lots), will remain operating into the foreseeable future, rather than undergo a liquidation.

Therefore, the financial statements have been prepared on a **""going concern basis""**.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

This is a simple example, that illustrates how different the liquidation value might be compared to the book value. Imagine if there was $1 billion of goodwill on the balance sheet. That's not something that you can sell.

Let me be clear, this post has nothing to do with Big Lots and its value. It is solely here for educational purposes. There are plenty of scenarios that could happen to the company in the future. It could become profitable again, it could get acquired, it could go bankrupt, or it could be in a tough spot for a long time.

I hope you enjoyed this post, and as always, thank you for reading it until the very end. ","['Nice write up!  All good points about book value.\n\nId still say book value is a really useful screener though.  I think P/B and P/S get a bad wrap on here even though both can be useful at times.  Especially if bond prices aren‚Äôt cheap and insiders are making large, and recent, share purchases.  It can lead to finding survival stocks instead of growth stocks, which I find to be the most fun.    Find a company that is in dire straights, heavily leveraged with debt coming due soon, is hated by everyone(except the customer), and is believed to be headed for bankruptcy.  If you can determine that everyone is wrong about the bankruptcy odds, it can lead to drastic outperformance.  \n\nIf you screen for P/B<0.75(depending on industry), + significant insider buying, and bond prices above 35 it can start you off with a good list of companies to perform some DD on.  The last 20 years has been great for this type of screener. Although no strategy works forever.\n\nUltimately, no single indicator, or multiple, will tell you if a company is selling for cheap, but P/B can be a nice part of the puzzle.', 'Nice words!', 'Seems like book value is a useless metric 99% of the time for us small fish investors', ""book value is an historical value that usually doesn't reflect current value take it with a grain of salt."", ""As for screening for Bond prices, is there a specific tool you would recommend? Most of the software I use doesn't have that data or maybe I just don't know where to look"", 'How so, like how does being a small fish investor in sizable public equities effect the usefulness of book value?', 'Because it‚Äôs mainly useful for liquidation', ""I think you're taking the example a bit too straightforward. The liquidation estimation shows that equity book value might not reflect it's **fair** value. Thus comparing market value with book value, and immediately concluding that a stock is cheap / undervalued could be a big mistake. That's the point. It doesn't mean that P/B is **mainly** useful for liquidation. Not many investors, even those who big enough to purchase controls of the companies, buy an undervalued stock only to liquidate and reap that book gap. \n\nP/B is a great **screening**, sometimes investors could really neglect such value gaps. Whether the gap is real or not, you need to study thoroughly (as I said, it's for screening only). The OP's example of Big Lots is when the gap is not true. But if it's true, and the company is still doing well. Sooner or later market force would drive up price, close that gap and you'll gain profits.

Over the long haul, she anticipates that PayPal‚Äôs transaction margins ‚Äúwill certainly be benefited‚Äù by factors such as accelerations in branded checkout and e-commerce growth, improved cross-border trends, and new value-added services.\n\nThe payments company reported second-quarter net income of $1.03 billion, or 92 cents a share, whereas it recorded a net loss of $341 million, or 29 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.

ValueInvesting,Why are value investors like Buffett so against EBITDA when it‚Äôs very similar to cash flow?,"Cash flow statements add back many of the same metrics like depreciation and amortization. It also *doesn‚Äôt* include SBC unlike cash flow. 

Can anyone explain why EBITDA is toxic to these investors when they use extremely similar metrics?","[""Because Capex is to a business what food is to a body builder. If you want to grow, you'll need plenty of Capex and good execution to do so. If growth is saturated and you are at your upper limit for your ability to allocate capital, you still need food, just less of it. Deny food, and you shrink, become weak, frail, and vulnerable. EBITDA removes that food cost in its entirety. Some portion of that food is only necessary today to facilitate growth, but another portion is necessary just to keep the business healthy. \n\nAnother reason is interest expense, and to a lesser extent, debt servicing. I've never understood this about EBITDA valuation. Why on earth would we give a company reprieve when it comes to the cost of their leverage? It only makes sense from an acquisition perspective when you are dealing with cash free debt free terms. Or if net debt is negative and you are acquiring a majority stake and can dictate financial governance going forward. It's a cost of doing business. Moreover, you should absolutely consider cash flow with total debt servicing, including principal payments. I've done LBO's where the EBITDA is just over a million, but for the next 7 years, $400k is going towards principal repayment and another $120k in interest. Total debt servicing will definitely affect management's ability to take on growth projects internally."", 'I would in no way call them extremely similar lol. Interest and Taxation are real significant costs for many many companies. Also most investors subtract SBC from FCF or calculate future dilution in modeling. Also the major thing you are forgetting is capital expenditure, there are very few companies where even maintenance capex matches D&A (i dont think deferred financing costs need maintenace capex if you pay off you‚Äôre debt which is a financing activity lol ), without even mention growth capital expenditure. Also CNWC for many companies such as retailers is very important for sake of reasonable capital returns based on capital needed in the business and FCF accounts for it.', '""We won‚Äôt buy into companies where someone‚Äôs talking about EBITDA. If you look at all companies, and split them into companies that use EBITDA as a metric and those that don‚Äôt, I suspect you‚Äôll find a lot more fraud in the former group. Look at companies like Wal-Mart, GE and Microsoft ‚Äî they‚Äôll never use EBITDA in their annual report.""\n\n""Does management think the tooth fairy pays for capital expenditures?""\n\n- Warren Buffett\n\n""People who use EBITDA are either trying to con you or they‚Äôre conning themselves. Telecoms, for example, spend every dime that‚Äôs coming in. Interest and taxes are real costs.""\n\n- Charlie Munger', 'EBITDA is a much better metric for control investors or private equity firms where they have control over the capital structure and capital investment. EBITDA allows for easier comparison across companies in the same industry as it removes the impact of capital structure and varying tax implications. \n\nThe reason EBITDA is important to PE and control investors is because they can change the capital structure and capital expenditure profile of the business, and EBITDA gives them a quick and dirty pre-tax ‚Äúcash flow‚Äù on an enterprise level. \n\nThe issue people run into is comparing EBITDA and EV/EBITDA across industries. A person should not compare EBITDA of an oilfield services company to the EBITDA of a tech company given that capex profile is significantly different between the two. You also wouldn‚Äôt want to say the oilfield services company is cheaper on an EV/EBITDA basis so it‚Äôs better value, because the reason it‚Äôs cheaper is because of capex.', ""So Buffet, from what I can recall, generally includes maintenance capex in his valuations.  There's a famous clip of him saying that businesses need capital to maintain themselves, so he doesn't consider it part of the cashflow.  In that sense what he's using is different because he actually counts depreciation and amortization as real costs (which they are)."", 'Interest, Taxes and Depreciation & Amortization are real costs.', 'How is EBITDA similar to cash flow?? Cash flow is just cash in and cash out. The income statement is much easier to manipulate to make the numbers look nicer. But EBITDA is what investment bankers use to justify higher valuations.

It‚Äôs Time to Buy the Stock.\n\nA renewed focus on lower costs and doing what it does best could help the media titan‚Äôs shares recover from a long slump.\n\nWalt Disney Ôøº‚Äôs films and theme parks have captured the hearts of millions, but its stock performance has been less than enchanting. Once a favorite of growth investors, shares have tumbled nearly 60% from their peak in 2021. With CEO Robert Iger ready to make some tough choices as he works to return the House of Mouse to its former glory, a path higher for the beaten-down shares is coming into view\n\nIf this were a fairy tale, Disney (ticker: DIS) could be compared with the kingdom in Sleeping Beauty: dormant, overrun with vines, and waiting for a hero to restore it to life. Perhaps Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has chosen to make an example of Disney for its opposition to a state law passed under his administration, would be cast as the wicked witch, and a recent box-office slump could be blamed on a nefarious spell that had fallen over the land\n\nBut this is the real world, and in the real world, Disney has been plagued by its own missteps. It is spending big on streaming, where profits remain elusive, while cable revenue continues to deteriorate. Its recent films, like Elemental and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, fell short of the mark set by Barbie, Oppenheimer, and even The Super Mario Bros. Movie. To repair the damage, Iger, who had stepped down in 2020, returned as CEO, taking over from Robert Chapek\n\nIger is no Prince Charming, but he has made clear that this is a whole new world for the media titan. With his contract extended for two years, until 2026, Iger has time to implement his vision for the company, one that centers on two pillars: streaming and theme parks. Everything else, including Disney‚Äôs cable channels, could be on the table for a possible sale. Disney is also taking steps to ensure that its earnings return to a more sustainable path. Costs have been cut, shows canceled, and a course forward‚Äîone that focuses on what Disney does well and profitably‚Äîcharted. Even the dividend, paused in 2020, could return by the end of this year. With its shares appearing cheap relative to its earnings and the sum of its parts, now looks like the right time to bet on the magic returning‚Äîat least to Disney‚Äôs stock.\n\n\nWalt Disney\n\nMedia and Entertainment\n\nHeadquarters\tBurbank, Calif.\n\nRecent Price\t$85.86\n\n52-Wk Change \t-14.0%\n\nMarket Value (bil)\t$158.8\n\n2024E Sales (bil)\t$94.2\n\n2024E Net Income (bil)\t$8.3\n\n2024E EPS\t$5.02\n\n2024E P/E\t17.1\n\nDividend\tNone\n\n\n‚ÄúRome wasn‚Äôt built in a day, and Disney‚Äôs problems won‚Äôt be solved in a year,‚Äù explains Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall. ‚ÄúBigger picture is, Disney seems to be taking increasingly bold actions.‚Äù\n\nNot that it has much of a choice. For now, the brightest spot in Disney‚Äôs portfolio is its theme parks, cruises, and consumer products business. The division, which represented more than a third of revenue last fiscal year, at $28.7 billion, and two-thirds of operating profits, at $7.9 billion, has benefited from pent-up demand for travel and experiences by consumers in the U.S. and abroad, keeping attendance high and giving Disney pricing power at its attractions. Management says that per capita spending at Disney‚Äôs parks is more than 40% higher than in 2019, thanks to premium offerings like Genie+ and Lightning Lane. Recent reports suggesting a drop-off in waiting times don‚Äôt change that.\n\n‚ÄúThe parks are a really powerful tollbooth on consumer discretionary spending,‚Äù says Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino. ‚ÄúThey attract consumers with higher purchasing power, whose spending tends to grow faster than nominal GDP. It‚Äôs a really nice structural position.‚Äù\n\nThe same can‚Äôt be said for Disney‚Äôs media business. Iger is faced with the thorny problem of balancing its growing, but expensive, streaming segment against its slowing cable business. Disney‚Äôs revenue from its linear networks, which include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel, FX, and National Geographic, was down 4% in the past four reported quarters, to $27.4 billion, as advertising sales slumped and customers cut the cord. The past year‚Äôs operating income dropped 11%, to $7.3 billion. Simply put, linear TV is caught in a doom loop: Higher churn and fewer subscribers prompt price increases to make up for lost revenue, increasing the incentive to cancel. Disney declined to comment for this article.\n\nStreaming has yet to take the baton. Disney‚Äôs direct-to-consumer segment lost $4.2 billion in the past four reported quarters on revenue of $20.8 billion, which was up 13%. But losses widened 77%, as content costs grew faster than subscription revenue. Disney‚Äôs fiscal third-quarter results, which correspond to the calendar second quarter, are due on Aug. 9.\n\n\nThings should improve as Iger focuses on running the streaming business for profitability, not merely subscriber growth. The company expects to have between 135 million and 165 million Disney+ subscribers outside of India by the end of its fiscal 2024, or September of next year, up from 104.9 million at the beginning of April. (Disney+ Hotstar in India adds another 53 million subscribers, but at an average monthly revenue of only 59 cents, versus $6.47 for core Disney+.) Management expects the streaming segment to reach break-even by the end of that year, though Wall Street isn‚Äôt convinced‚Äîanalysts expect a streaming loss of about $500 million in fiscal 2024.\n\nStill, there‚Äôs no denying that Disney remains a must-have for children of all ages, with popular shows like The Mandalorian and movies like Frozen on repeat. Disney plans to raise prices for the advertising-free tier of Disney+, which costs $11 a month in the U.S., $3 more than the ad-supported version, and more hikes are in store abroad. It‚Äôs likely most subscribers will simply pay the higher bill.\n\n‚ÄúPixar, Marvel, and Star Wars are taxes on parents,‚Äù says Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at J. Stern & Co. ‚ÄúYou have no choice but to subscribe, and that gives Disney pricing power.‚Äù\n\nOther big changes are coming that should help Disney meet its numbers. Disney has all but promised to purchase the one-third of Hulu, with its 48 million subscribers, that it doesn‚Äôt own from Comcast Ôøº (CMCSA) by early next year, which could come with a price tag of nearly $10 billion. There are benefits of bringing ownership fully in house. Hulu features adult-oriented content that can appeal beyond the more family-friendly Disney+ franchises.', 'I‚Äôm doubtful. Disney doesn‚Äôt know how to make movies like it used to.', '\nWe have an opportunity to buy a great company at a great price. Our job as investors is to find out whether the problems affecting Disney is a temporary one or a permanent one (which will require a re-valuation of the company). \n\nWhat are temporary problems? Poor programming, over-crowding at the parks, writer‚Äôs strike, disney+ not contributing to the bottom line, lousy movies and TV series this year thus far. (Indiana Jones, Elemental, Secret Invasion, Mermaid). I will argue that cultural wars and even the high profile fight in Florida are just temporary problems. \n\nWhat are permanent problems? So far, I think Linear programming is going away for good due to streaming. \n\nI wrote a short 2 pager on Disney previously, and concluded that experience and leadership is what is needed. \n\nWhen do I think the problems will be fixed ? Well, judging by the contract extension, I would say Bob Iger has three years to fix the problem. So how much would you demand a rate of return for three years while Disney fixes the problems and figure a way out of the linear programming issue and the poor ARPU of Disney+ Hotstar in India? Double your investment? Or worst case 50% returns in three years?\n\nI am quite impressed when people say, let‚Äôs wait until the company turns around, then I will invest. In my experience, markets are efficient enough that by then it would be too late.\n\nThis is a good time for the patient investor to work out an investment plan on Disney:\n\n- if they announce (in the next 2 weeks) good results in the quarter and the stock rises, should I buy?\n\n- if they announce worsening results like more defections from India, is this a good thing since the ARPU is only 59 cents. Or should they optimise it like how Spotify does it, on demand per day  pricing? What if the share price continue to swoon, should the patient investor buy all at once or stagger the purchase over time?\n\nAnd if the answer is yes, what are the key signs to watch out for? Is dividend reinstatement a sign that the company is confident of the future or is that just placating major shareholders while the company works out the problems?\n\nJust my 2 cents. I still have some Disney shares and I intend to nibble in 1/3s starting at $80.\n\n(Clarification: I am not suggesting blind faith in Bob Iger and invest in Disney, I am suggesting how to think about Disney as a potential investment. )', ""The problem is that this all depends on the content.

ValueInvesting,What are some of the most OVERvalued stocks right now?,"I'm looking to make my portfolio a bit more delta neutral to prepare for September. I've had good success in the past on long put diagonial debit spreads  (basically the same as a PMCC, but assuming a bearish outlook) on PGR, MCD, and MKC. I know most people are going to list things like Carvana, NVDA, etc., but I was thinking more in terms of ""stable"" stocks (stocks that aren't growing at unpredictable rates or have huge catalysts on the horizon).

If I had to pick some, I'd pick McDonald's (MCD) and McCormick (MKC), which are trading at near all-time high P/CF, P/E forward, EV/sales, and aren't doing any better than in the past (in fact, worse). Dividend yield lower than bonds which, historically (for MCD at least), has lead to losses near-term. Why these stocks are trading at forward P/E's higher than Google seems absurd to me.

But curious some other stocks people think are crazy overvalued right now that aren't crazy volatile? Also, what metrics do you use to judge an overvalued company?

ValueInvesting,Defensive/Blue Chip Overvaluation & Potential Bubble,"I will preface this discussion by saying I may be wrong - but the math isn't adding up for me. I believe that there is severe overvaluation in what I would consider 'defensive' investment in 'quality companies'. I define these companies is large, conservatively capitalized companies, with dominant market positions, minimal reinvestment requirements. Essentially, durable franchises that have stood the test of time. While the debate has always been centered around growth vs value, these franchises do not fit in either category. I will also say that I do subscribe to the McKinsey theory of valuation that states that revenue growth and ROIC drive valuation, and therefore these durable franchises should trade at higher valuations. But even so, I can't understand how many of these franchises get their valuation. 

It first hit me when I valued ADP recently, as I have owned it in the past and I think it's a great business. My DCF indicates that for the valuation to be reasonable at this price, the following must happen:

1. Margins must remain historically high
2. Revenue growth of 10% for the next 10 years (trailing 5/10 year revenue growth is about 6%).
3. Terminal growth of 3.5%

When I plug in more reasonable assumptions (stable margins, but 5% revenue growth and 2% terminal growth) ADP appears severely overvalued.

What's crazy is this isn't the most extreme case. I see many blue chips trading at 30-60x earnings/cash flow. I don't see how anyone owning these stocks at these prices will see a decent return over time.

ValueInvesting,"I came across this email from a denied VIC submission of mine in May of 2008, nice little 25 bagger on Hansen's natural, now MNST. To me this was a good example of value and growth intersecting.","I am recommending a long position in Hansen‚Äôs Natural and, though Hansen‚Äôs was written up on VIC in the past as a short topic, I believe the failure of this idea is inherent in Hansen‚Äôs under-valued capital structure.  At 20x earnings Hansen‚Äôs Natural is failing to appear on many value screens, and I offer no assurance in lack of downside risk.  But this is a great time to start averaging into this stock.  They have made tremendous returns on capital and all manufacturing is outsourced keeping cap ex low.  These returns should bolster stock value and create a culture of mutual gain.  
	The lion‚Äôs share of Hansen‚Äôs revenue comes from the Monster Energy Drink product line.  Over the last decade the Monster line has grown an exceptionally large clip and has become the most popular energy drink brand in North America, second only to Red Bull.  They have used extreme-sport sponsorship and marketing that resonates with young people to develop a strong and loyal following.  This, paired with the struggling economy and current market saturation, has led to above average growth rates and earnings.  
	The biggest struggle Hansen‚Äôs had in the past was gaining on distribution, but they are now pursuing overseas distribution in the United Kingdom starting this quarter.  The Monster brand will travel to Europe well because the target demographic already recognizes the brand via it‚Äôs presence in extreme sports.  And using these means, Coke and Pepsi have, in complete futility, tried to take a market share in the energy drink community.  Both powerhouses created brand after brand of energy drink and only succeeded in further fragmenting the market.  This mess leaves the Monster brand standing stronger that ever while Coke and Pepsi have shifted to flavored waters like Glaceau and Vitamin Water.  
	The recent price drop in Hansen‚Äôs shares is largely two-fold.  Growth is slowing and settling in the 15-25% range while the company has been growing at an over 40% clip since 2003.  Some investors may have taken to the ridiculous notion that this could go on forever.  With the slowing growth the company‚Äôs margins are also contracting, and this is a result of higher gross material cost and changing product mix.    
	The Java Monster drink is a coffee and milk drink that competes directly with Pepsi‚Äôs Starbucks drinks.  The margin on these drinks is not as high as with regular Monster, which is basically glucose, water, and supplements.  Java has been selling well and has very respectable margins.  I believe some are looking at the margin compression in the wrong way.  Java has a lower margin but it grows faster, and the amount of capital that is required for growth is essentially zero.  
	Higher commodity costs may continue to hurt margins, but given the high margins that Hansen‚Äôs operates at and the strength of the brand, medium-term higher commodity prices could lead to an increase in market share for Hansen‚Äôs.  There are over four hundred energy drink brands in the U.S.  Many of these brands are small with limited distribution and pricing power.  Lower medium-term margins should remove some of these competitors leaving Monster and Red Bull to absorb new customers.  
	Since there are low capital requirements the company has had difficulty allocating capital.  The company does not pay a dividend and only recently initiated a share repurchase program for up to 200 million dollars.  Nearly all of the earnings over the last 5 years have been retained while resisting the temptation to buy back shares at high valuations.  Keeping large amounts of cash will now pay off for share holders through this buyback.  
	For over a year now, there have been rumors that Hansen‚Äôs is a huge buyout target.  Now, the share price has come down, and these rumors may come to fruition.  All three of the companies that distribute monster have been named as possible candidates.  But the market is currently presenting an opportunity to buy a quality brand that has high margins, good growth prospects, a loyal following and extremely high returns on invested capital.  
Catalysts:  
Possible buyout by Pepsi, Budweiser, or Cadbury  
Growth into Europe  
Continued growth of the Java Monster brand

ValueInvesting,Pabrai sells all his Micron $MU shares and bets on coal through $AMR and $CEIX. Thoughts?,"Pabrai Investments' Q2 filings show that Pabrai offloaded all his US stocks, including Micron - which previously made up over 80% of his entire US-based portfolio.  Although he had already sold some $MU in Q1, I'm surprised to see him get out of the positions entirely.

Any thoughts on what his motive is here?

The US portion of his portfolio now consists of just two stocks, both new additions:

* Alpha Metallurgical Resources $AMR (81.8%) - a mining company specialising in thermal and metallurgical coal.
* CONSOL Energy $CEIX (18.2%) - a mining company specialising in bituminous coal.

ValueInvesting,Help with understanding Buffet valuation method,"I've recently been reading Mary Buffet and David Clark's ""Warren Buffet and the Interpretation of Financial Statements."" In it, they discuss the way Buffet would value a stock as follows:

>In 1987 Warren started buying shares in Coca-Cola for an average price of $6.50 a share against pretax earnings of $.70 a share; this equates to after-tax earnings of $.46 a share. Historically, Coca-Cola‚Äôs earnings had been growing at an annual rate of around 10%. Seeing this, Warren could argue that he had just bought a Coca-Cola equity bond paying an initial pretax interest rate of 10.7% on his $6.50 investment. He could also argue that that pretax yield would increase over time at a projected annual rate of 10% (Coca-Cola‚Äôs average annual rate of earnings growth for the ten years prior to 1987 ...  
>  
>So what was a pretax 66% return on a $6.50 equity bond in 2007 worth in 1987? It depends on the discount rate that we use. If we use 7%, which is right about what long-term rates were back then, we get a discounted back value of approximately 17%. Multiply 17% by the $6.50 a share he was paying for and we would get $1.10 a share. Multiply $1.10 by Coca-Cola‚Äôs 1987 P/E of 14 and we get $15.40 per share. Thus Warren could have argued in 1987 that he was buying an equity bond for $6.50 a share, and that if he held it for twenty years, its 1987 intrinsic value really would be $15.40 a share.

I am a bit confused on the second paragraph. How is the discounted value of approximately 17% derived? And what are we doing conceptually by multiplying that discounted back value of 17% by the current (1987) price-per-share and P/E ratio? 

&#x200B;","["">How is the discounted value of approximately 17% derived?\n\nThey are discounting the 66% back 20 years at a 7% discount rate. 66/(1.07^20)\n\n>And what are we doing conceptually by multiplying that discounted back value of 17% by the current (1987) price-per-share and P/E ratio?\n\nThey are assuming that the value of the company will trade at a similar valuation.\n\nThe 1.10 is the present value of the future cash flow in the year 2007. They take this multiply it by the PE and get the value the company should be trading at with its current valuation.\n\n\nMy question is, why did they do this in such a convoluted way? They are compounding and discounting the earnings yield instead of just the income itself and then converting at the end.\n\nAlso, I have no idea where that 66% comes from. What are they compounding to get that? If I compound the income and divide by share price, it's ~72 percent. If I compound the income yield, it's a slightly lower ~72%"", ""That's an almost interesting mental exercise, but it has nothing to do with why Warren bought Coke. \n\nI've never heard good things about Mary Buffet, to be honest.

They multiply that 17% return by the price per share in 1987 to get his return per share of $1.10.\n\nIn 1987 based on their P/E of 14 it cost $14 to buy $1 worth of KO earnings, but since Warren ended up getting $1.10 for every share he purchased you could argue that the intrinsic value of KO at the time was $15.40 (14 * 1.1).', '1.10/6.5 is how they got the 17%, as for the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of your question, i have no idea, seems like a really over complicated way to say, buying coke as a business would yield more yoy than putting that same amount in government bonds', 'Damn you gonna blast Mary Buffett like that?', ""From what I know of her, she's not particularly admirable. She's Peter's ex-wife, she's written a number of book's trading on Warren's name, as if she had special knowledge of Warren's investing, but she never did. From what I know, Warren never gave her interviews or worked with her in any way on her books. That's why they have other co-authors to fill in the financial material. She's pretty much guessing at Warren's methods as much as anyone else, and relying mostly on public information. \n\nThis post is a good example of why you should be careful about reading her, if you bother reading her at all. The inside story of why Warren bought Coke is in Roger Lowenstein's Buffet biography. And that's much more revealing, and correct, than the DCF analysis presented here.""]"

ValueInvesting,What's a broad thumb rule to identify if a company is fairly valued?,"Peter Lynch advocates that the 10 or 5 yr PAT growth should be more or at least equal to the 10 yr/ 5yr median or TTM PE. This would be what's commonly known as the PEG ratio. Investors would be willing to buy a company at a PE that's close to the 5 yr PAT growth and if the company still performs well, the investor would perform adequately well. This would be Peter Lynch's thumb rule for fairly valued businesses.

I was wondering whether ROE would be a better substitute for growth? So over the long term PE should be somewhat equal to the long-term sustainable ROE of the firm? ie. 

* PE > 5yr avg ROE - Overvalued
* PE < 5yr avg ROE - Undervalued
* PE = 5yr avg ROE - Fairly valued.

Is ROE a more important metric than PAT growth? Also, assume the companies involved for this evaluation are debt free/ low debt.

What do you think about this framework?","[""I think it makes little sense.\n\nBoth rely on past accounting standard earnings that usually mislead with non-recurring and none-cash expenses/gains and are backward looking.\n\nYou should get a conservative estimate of future owners' earnings.\n\nOther than that, ROE is skewed in leveraged companies, so roic would probably be more relevant.\n\nAlso, PEG is either looking backward or using analyst estimates of future forward earnings that are consistently wrong\n\nGenerally, the past history of consistent high roic is a good indicator of quality, and other than that, you should probably do the work to get to a rough estimate of value"", 'I have been looking at ROE recently.

ValueInvesting,Tax-efficient investing - what should the ideal portfolio look like?,"While I've done my fair amount of research, it's still best to ask this question here where actual people can give their best answers and personal experiences, good or bad - how do you find and operate tax-free trading accounts (or as tax-efficient as possible) while actually having a diverse and profitable portfolio? I'm not the biggest expert, but a variety of assets like stock and crypto are all good, as long as you can actively look for and invest in the best prospects (while being taxed as little as the laws allow).  
First of all, I've read about Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), which are supposed to be the most flexible ones in terms of tax - capital gains and withdrawals are free on several platforms (for some assets). My question is - where do you find these types of accounts exactly, and how do they really work?   
Are they supposed to be legal throughout Canada because the number of assets/stocks/etc is limited? Or are there other workarounds that are ""basically"" legal but are best avoided? It's not that I don't want to be taxed... but when the profit margins are small, you end up feeling like it's an endless uphill battle, and you take any help you can get.  
At the same time, I'm also interested in how you guys use bots to maximize efficiency when buying/selling/finding new options - do you use specialized platforms and AI-based bots? Or do you prefer simpler ones that you just program to buy/sell at a certain price?

ValueInvesting,Is free cash flow still a useful metric?,"A lot of people on this sub adjust free cash flow by subtracting the stock based compensation expense, something I agree with.

However, I rarely see it adjusted for operating lease payments that can either be classified as cash flows from operating activities (included in free cash flow) or cash flows from financing activities (excluded from free cash flow).

It‚Äôs can also be similar for loan repayments.  Note that I analyse companies from different countries, but it means I need to create my own adjusted free cash flow figures for every company I analyse.  It‚Äôs rare that my adjusted free cash flow agrees to those readily available on websites like quickfs or those used in management discussions.

Some interesting consequences of this, since IFRS 16 (the accounting standard that brought about the right of use accounting) has been introduced, this has inflated free cash flow well above GAAP earnings for many companies given that rent payments can effectively be taken out of the free cash flow computation.  I‚Äôm certain many people have made bad decisions on these without realising the mistake they made.

Any thoughts on this?","['It is the only one that matters.

The most important thing to remember this is all just used to ESTIMATE intrinsic value, nobody really knows exactly. \n\nI try to tie operating profits to the balance sheet, as a way of tethering my expectations of the future. Growth requires investment, which lowers current cash flows. Investment increases the size of the balance sheet. ROIC is the governor of growth, if growth exceeds ROIC the business needs external sources of capital.\n\nPeople get into trouble when they project growing cash flows and a shrinking balance sheet into the future.

I back out the change in working capital, regardless if positive or negative, to maintain the company‚Äôs liquidity position when net working capital falls, or maintain the increase in working capital from operational cash flows when net working capital rises.

Currently doesn\'t seem to go into Vikings favor, but if you assume the firm will recover just a fraction of its public market ATH, it can become a rainmaker.\n\nAs to why they might structure something like this: \n- A bit more risk protection for investors than pure equity (probably not a factor here, seems to be a binary play)\n- Legal protection and power (can set contractual obligations and covenants, depending on negotiation)\n- Avoidance of change of control/ take-over risk\n- Given the company is publicly traded you don\'t have to deal with the hassle that would be an SEO', 'Options have value.

ValueInvesting,"$ATKR Atkore Inc, just a cyclical company at its peak?","Hi guys, i was looking for a stock to pick and came across this company. I know ATKR is not so underrated to find out in 2023 but for me individual stock picking is a new thing. Below is my analysis and thoughts. I would like to hear your opinion about the company.  
  
**Company brief description:**  
  
ATKR manufactures and sells electrical and infrastructure products both in the US and internationally. The company offers electrical products including conduits cables and other accessories. It serves a group of end markets including new costruction, infrastructure, alternative power generation, and others.  
  
**Why ATKR:**  
  
Over the last three years the company had a strong growth in revenue, ebitda, net income and any other valuable metric. The company went from $1.9b of revenue in 2019 to $3.9 in 2022. The Ebitda margin grew from 16% to 34% in the same period. ROIC (CFO % Net invested capital) went from 21% to 46%.  
  
Even though YTD market cap growth have been already impressive (c.25%), i believe there is still space for future growth. In fact, multiples seems still good for a possible entry. Furthermore, i think that in the future the company will pay dividends with the excess of cash generated in 2020-2022. Last dividends paid were in 2021.  
  
Another strong point is its stock buyback campaign.  
  
Here some numbers: https://imgur.com/PGxdJ3H  
  
**My concerns:**  
  
The most relevant doubt is about its cyclicality. ATKR is definitely a cyclical company linked to construction and infrastructure and in general those companies make sense when bought with low and bad metrics. Hence, the company could be at a peak and everyone that look for value stocks like me already had it on their radar so there is the risk of buying at a top right now.  
  
What do you think of the construction sector? Do you think that have reached its peak?","['With respect, I think you\'re missing the point on ATKR, a company I know well and own myself (and my first 10 bagger fwiw).\n\nThe strong growth trends from the last couple of years need to be massively adjusted to normalize for a windfall event ATKR capitalized on. This came about when COVID played havoc with the world\'s supply chains. ATKR and its competitors sell products that are, on balance, a relatively tiny part of the total project budget (low single digit %\'s in most cases) but their products are essential to the construction process. Timely deliveries are crucial to keeping projects on schedule and not having the armored cable or PVC shipments arrive on time can mean having to idle entire crews and sites for days or weeks, leading to cost overruns and deadline extensions.\n\nPre-COVID, it was a given that orders could be delivered as promised by everyone, but COVID put everyone\'s logistics to the test and ATKR\'s competitors failed. They couldn\'t step up and engineer the improvements/solutions necessary to keep their customers supplied in a timely manner but ATKR did. This gave them *incredible* pricing power because, as I mentioned above, the products being sold are a fraction of the project budget. If you need new shoelaces to wear your best dress shoes to your wedding, are you going to balk at paying $5 instead of $2 if the $5 laces will be in your hands today and the $2 laces won\'t be there until after the wedding? Probably not, right? And that was how it played out for ATKR and its customers during the supply chain crunch. \n\nNow, that supply chain crunch is basically solved at this point. There are a few lingering kinks here and there with some harder-to-source materials, but for the purposes of this surface-level discussion, we can zero out most of the pricing advantage ATKR enjoyed. It was, after all, always going to be a temporary thing, hence the windfall moniker. Some of the pricing premium is proving to be surprisingly sticky, mainly because customers have seen what it\'s like when orders aren\'t delivered as promised and many of them don\'t mind paying a little more to source from a supplier they can trust, but we\'re talking very minor premiums here, not the massive revenue-pumping ones from before. \n\nThat\'s the bad news. The good news is that ATKR never needed the windfall, it just kinda happened to them. Even after normalizing the windfall years, it\'s plain to see that ATKR\'s EBITDA is on track for about a 25% CAGR. I bring all this up because a surprising side effect of the windfall is that it has, apparently, obscured the strength of ATKR\'s core business, making it quite difficult for most. Even industry analysts and the sell side have taken forever to piece it all together (although the sell side is *finally* waking up to the potential here based on some of the more recent reports that have slid across my desk). The consensus bear thesis I keep running into is that ATKR was a mediocre business in a mediocre industry and is being entirely propped up by windfall pricing which will fade and then everything will come crashing down to 5-8% annual top-line growth, ""meh"" EBITDA margins, and the resulting 6-8x earnings multiple a weak business like that deserves. \n\nNow, I can\'t go into all the reasons why that\'s wrong because my brief on ATKR is about 60 pgs long, but I think I can concisely state a really important driver of the ATKR investment thesis which is their moat. Every other argument I make to rebut the bear claims eventually winds its way back to the moat anyway, so it really is, as is often the case, the heart of the thesis. \n\nTo begin with, ATKR is better run. High-quality management runs the company, but they themselves usually give credit to the ATKR business system, which is really just copied from Danaher. Still, many of them worked at DHR so they know that legendary system inside and out. When they credit the ""ATKR business system"" AKA ""Danaher 2.0,"" they mean it, they follow it, and it works. Being better run means they are able to produce at lower cost and deliver with a faster response time. The latter is currently an industry leading 4 days and headed to just 1 day in the near future. For proof of superior cost controls, just compare ATKR\'s margins to peer comps and it\'ll become quite obvious.\r  \n\r  \nI touched on this above, but being well-run also makes them able to reliably deliver what they say they will. The pandemic exposed competitors as being unable to do this, causing huge headaches for customers on SKUs that are a tiny part of their overall cost. Delaying construction for weeks while they await delivery of some pipe that may cost a few hundred dollars has made customers see the light, and they are willing to pay more for ATKR as a result. So that\'s the second part. They have earned customers\' trust.\r  \n\r  \nThird, shipping is a big component of the cost for ATKR\'s products so scale really matters. ATKR has manufacturing infrastructure laid in all over the country so on average, ATKR products are shipped a shorter distance than competitors\' products. They are the low-cost provider as a result. Yes, even lower than China, another ridiculous bear argument I have to stomp out routinely. A lot of people are terrified of government-subsidized Chinese businesses disrupting various industries in the US, and maybe that\'s a valid fear in some cases, but it\'s not here and I can explain it very simply. \n\nImagine something like a PVC pipe; it\'s just a lightweight, hollow tube but it takes up a ton of space. That\'s fine if you only have to ship it 100 miles on an open truck bed, but what about across an ocean? Imagine the shipping costs based on the volume of space required to ship something like PVC pipes. You\'d basically be paying to ship air. Then the pipes themselves are high margin, sure, but very cheap, also. Nobody is going to pay $10k for a PVC pipe, regardless of what your shipping costs are, making the entire premise a nonstarter imo. \r  \n\r  \nFourth, while ATKR has competitors in every segment, it\'s not the same competitor. Meanwhile, all of ATKR\'s business segments enjoy the synergy of operating under the ATKR umbrella, meaning ATKR can deliver more SKUs in an order, on one truck, with one delivery, than anyone else can. It\'s more convenient for the customer (who doesn\'t have to work with multiple suppliers to get everything they need if they can buy it all from ATKR) and less expensive for ATKR. \r\r  \n\r  \nFifth, ATKR only operates in segments that are national duopolies or 3-opolies. There\'s always going to be some small fries that compete locally but even as an aggregate, they don\'t represent a significant threat of duopoly/3-opoly disruption. This is important because historically, poorly run businesses in this industry like to compete away margins, undercutting each other to a spiteful degree until half of them are bankrupt and the other half has to consolidate into a single entity just to survive. That\'s actually how a lot of the modern-day oligopolies in this sector formed but that\'s a story for another day. \r  \n\r\n\nSixth, they continue to roll up the aforementioned small fries. They\'re not a threat, but ATKR\'s management team knows that numerous small but accretive acquisitions will add up over time and they recognize the value of seizing every opportunity they can. They are helped greatly in this by the fact that the industry has weak management talent as a whole, meaning there have been multiple deals ATKR has managed to close without any serious competing bids coming in. Every time they do this, the moat deepens.\n\nEvery investor is going to define a company\'s moat differently, and I\'m not trying to pitch this as ""THE MOAT"" or anything ridiculous like that. Everything written here is just my opinion but it is an opinion that was crystallized after hundreds of hours of research into ATKR, the industry, the competitors, speaking with management, speaking with other analysts I respect, etc. \n\nBut really, regardless of how one likes to delineate ATKR\'s moat, *something* has to explain their EBITDA/share CAGR being 25% for 10Y using normalized EBITDA. Using unadjusted windfall EBITDA gives us 44% CAGR, but I\'ve explained why I think that\'s the wrong approach already. Still, normalized EBITDA growth at that pace, without much debt, without any drama, just steady execution and best-in-class management, deserves a close look from most investors imo. \n\nI mean, I only own 4 stocks and ATKR is one of them if that gives you any sense of my confidence in the business.', 'ATKR is a serial acquirer in the electrical infrastructure market. Im working on a thesis for this company right now. Yes that market is cyclical in the sense that construction is cyclical, its even cyclical in the sense that the price of copper wire and materials they sell is cyclical, Hence the outstanding ROIC the company has earned the last few years.\n\nbut remember it is still a serial  acquirer, the primary way in which they grow is through acquisition, which means they need a large pond to go fishing in if they want to continue to grow in the long term. Which also means they need to continue to expand into new product categories to expand their TAM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm a general contractor, so I can say for sure there are plenty of little niche electrical companies that can be acquired and rolled up, but they also need to buy them at a reasonable price.', 'I have nothing to add about about the company itself, but regarding cyclicality you have to consider the rising demand in electrical infrastructure in the coming years. Government is creating a big ‚Äòartificial‚Äô demand surplus for the coming years. Is this environment ‚Äòregular‚Äô, for a lack of a better word, cyclical behavior might be disturbed through highly unusual market conditions. Just my 2 cents.', 'I started a position this year, wish I found them earlier but I am already up a good amount. Just a fantastic business plan with great management in an important market. There is already a great write up on this company here so I won‚Äôt say much more. I think they have 10 bagger potential from here.', 'This comment explains why I like Reddit‚Ä¶ thanks for sharing your analysis and your knowledge‚Ä¶ if I may, what‚Äôs the sector of the other three stocks you own?', 'An excellent articulation of the Bull Case.  Thank you for sharing it.', 'hey man if you wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing it i would love to read your brief on Atkore seems like you know the company pretty well to say the least', 'What are the other three stocks you own? Thanks for the analysis‚Äîthat was truly insightful.', 'This is fantastic thank you for your (clearly valuable) thoughts!\n\nI‚Äôm curious when you formed this thesis?', ""Thanks.\n\nI saw the company on Magic Formula and didn't buy out of fear for construction weakness during massive interest rate increases. \n\nI heard someone mention that politicians pushing massive electrification of everything including vehicles being positive for ATKR. That sounds right to me, broadly, although I also think politicians have not done the math on how incredibly expensive that would be.\n\nThoughts on that?""]"
ValueInvesting,Occidental Buys Back $522 Million of Berkshire Preferred Stock - Bloomberg,"

(Bloomberg) -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. bought back $522 million of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.‚Äôs preferred stock in the second quarter, demonstrating its willingness to repay Warren Buffett even as commodity prices drop.  
  
The purchase brings Occidental‚Äôs redemptions this year to 12% of Berkshire‚Äôs initial $10 billion investment, which was used to fund the producer‚Äôs acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in 2019. Berkshire‚Äôs preferred stock carries an 8% annual dividend, making it an expensive part of Occidental‚Äôs capital structure.  
  
Separately, Berkshire owns 25% of Occidental‚Äôs common stock and is the company‚Äôs largest shareholder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Berkshire is willing to buy more Occidental common stock, Buffett said at its shareholder meeting in Omaha earlier this year. However, he ruled out buying the oil producer in its entirety.  
  
Occidental shares dropped as much as 2.7% in after-market trading as the company missed analysts‚Äô earnings estimates because of weaker realized prices for its gas production. The company raised its 2023 production guidance 1.3%, but also reported higher capital spending than expected.","['Good thing I own both. \n\nBuffet likes money.

He might be right, in order to exist, there must be other participants realising of the value.

He says that now with the Passive Investment, the quants and everyone following hot stocks, no one knows what value is. As no one knows how to do a valuation of a company, value investing has no space.

ValueInvesting,I lost trust in my thesis for para.,"Hey guys.

I lost trust in my thesis.

Im not sure about Paramount Global anymore. They are continuing to lose money.  Their ROA, ROIC and all the other metrics are negativ from a high two-digit number and I am currently down 25%. Also I dont think that it can compete with the rest of the industry.
I just don't see sense in keeping the stock because of the unhealthiness of the company.

The only points speaking for keeping the company are that Warren Buffett is holding a small amount and their Price-to-book ratio is 0.5.

Please let me know your thought on Para","[""if your thesis for the business was incorrect, then sell\n\n- i would add however: the company (bob bakish the CEO in particular) was very clear that 2023 would be loss-making, and a return to profitability would happen in 2024 with a focus on debt reduction\n\n- there's also the issues of, in no particular order: shari redstone selling/not selling, wall street shorting it to shit after the bill hwang fiasco, the debt load (although nothing compared to e.g warner brothers), the value of the assets on the balance sheet, buffett steaming in and holding 15% of the B shares while publicly bad-mouthing it, paramount+ growing like berserk, advertising profits/costs being central to their business etc.\n\nthat is a lot of moving parts! if it is too difficult for you to figure out, then be honest and move onto something else. there is nothing wrong with that; it is the correct thing to do\n\n- as i said: paramount's destination & wall street being furious that shari redstone hasn't sold yet haven't changed over the past year or 18 months. all that's changed is the stock price and everyone screaming about buffett being involved\n\nlastly: i will add that basing your investments on whether buffett (or any *'super-investor'* for that matter) is buying or selling and/or the price-to-book metric will cause you to have a miserable time re. investing"", 'The market doesnt ascribe enough value to the cashflows of linear media, its still a cash cow despite the decline.

ValueInvesting,How to identify a strong moat?,"Hello guys. 

I recently informed myself about the cementproducing industry and I found out that the market leader is Holcim. Just because Holcim is the market leader doesn't mean they have a strong moat, right?

There is as an example one interesting participants called Buzzi which is growing stronger and seemingly increasing marketshare. Buzzi got a higher ROIC and profitmargin which seems for me that management is doing a better job investing their money.

So my question is, how to identify a strong moat?","['Sustained strong ROIC (i.e., 15%+) and other profitability ratios over time.', 'I‚Äôm not the best explainer but pretty much there a bunch of things that can be used to view it: stickiness of service or product, barriers to entry for new participants whether it be capital or expertise, regulation, profitability is only at scale.\n\nIt‚Äôs better to just look at a variety of large companies and research/think of there moats as they can vary wildly.\n\nA good example is Charles Schwab, specifically their brokerage side. Basically Charles Schwab is an extremely complex and very regulated financial insitution. This made it so that when Schwab was the first to slash commissions, it immediately created a huge barrier to entry for retail brokers as commissions for Schwab wasn‚Äôt a huge part of profit, but for E*Trade, RH, IBKR, WeBull, it was the majority of profit. Because Schwab has a wholly owned banking subsidiary and is regulated, it can sweep off sheet deposits and make most money from interest on securities, not margin lending only .', ""Higher margins than peers is definitely a good sign. Especially margins that are trending up over time. Coupled with high and stable ROIC is probably the best quick and dirty quantitative way to identify a moat imo.\n\nAnd if those metrics are outpacing peers, that could be a sign of a growing/stronger moat than competitors.\n\nAnd I think a key factor here is that the numbers aren't just a one-off or couple years of improvement but a steady change over time. Cost-cutting measures can have a temporary impact on the numbers, but incremental improvements in business operations or product/service quality are what really matters over the long-term."", ""> I recently informed myself about the cementproducing industry and I found out that the market leader is Holcim.

To better understand the company, any metric being used has to be broken down to a level that reflects key drivers of the company's business model. For example, ROIC can be broken down to NOPAT \\* Capital Velocity, then compare these metrics to peers. It can go deeper to the key drivers level. 2) Top-down analysis is more from the industry/market segment level, for example, using market share analysis to test industry stability.

ValueInvesting,Article: Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs Operating Profits Rose 6% in Second Quarter,"[Barron‚Äôs: Berkshire Hathaway's Operating Profits Rose 6% in Second Quarter](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-earnings-warren-buffett-34659069?st=6qsvfdeh4pdse9g)

Berkshire's operating profits were boosted by strength in insurance underwriting and higher investment income.

Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs s operating earnings after taxes rose 6% to $10 billion in the second quarter, the company reported Saturday, marking a new quarterly record, while overall results swung to a profit of $35.9 billion from a loss of $43.6 billion in the year-earlier period due to gains in the company's equity portfolio.
Berkshire's operating profits were boosted by strength in insurance underwriting and higher investment income.

Berkshire's stock repurchases totaled $1.4 billion in the second quarter, compared with $4.4 billion in the first quarter and $1 billion for the year-earlier period.

CEO Warren Buffett is price-sensitive with share buybacks and may have reduced them in the second quarter from the first quarter due to the appreciation in Berkshire stock, which was up 10% in the second quarter. The second-quarter repurchases were below an estimate of $2.2 billion from UBS analyst Brian Meredith.

Investors focus on Berkshire's stock repurchases as an indication of whether Buffett views the stock as cheap. The class A shares recently hit a record high and finished Friday at $533,600 after dropping 1.4% in the session.

Operating earnings per class A share totaled about $6,928, up 8% from the year-earlier period, easily topping the FactSet consensus of $5,576 per share, Barron's estimates, and setting a new quarterly record.

Buffett tells investors to focus on the operating earnings that excludes changes in the value of Berkshire's roughly $353 billion equity portfolio that need to be included in earnings based on accounting rules.

Overall earnings of $35.9 billion in the second quarter included investment gains of $25.9 billion, while the year-ago quarter showed losses of $53 billion due to weakness in the stock market.

Berkshire benefited in the latest quarter from appreciation in its equity portfolio largely due to strength in Apple (AAPL), which accounts for half of it. Apple rose 17% in the second quarter.

The Berkshire 10-O filing, also released Saturday, indicates that the company pared its big equity stake in Chevron to about 123 million shares on June 30 from 132 million on March 31, after cutting that holding by about 35 million shares in the first quarter.

Berkshire held $19.4 billion of the big energy company on June 30. Berkshire's largest equity holding, Apple, was unchanged in the second quarter, remaining at about 915 million shares worth $177.6 billion, or about half the company's equity portfolio.

Berkshire was sitting on $147 billion of cash and equivalents on June 30, mostly U.S. Treasury bills, compared with $130 billion at the end of March.

The higher cash position reflected sales of stocks by Berkshire in the period.

Berkshire's asset base topped $ 1 trillion in the second quarter, ending the period at $1.04 trillion.

That's a notable milestone for a company that had less than $30 million of assets in 1964, just before Buffett, 92, took control in 1965. Berkshire's shareholder equity stood at $540 billion at the end of second quarter, up from $22 million in 1964.

Berkshire's appetite for stocks was muted in the second quarter. It was a net seller of about $8
billion of stocks after being a net seller of about $10 billion in the first quarter, Barron's estimates based on its cash-flow statement in the 10-Q. Berkshire sold some stock in Activision Blizzard in the second quarter. So far this year, Berkshire has bought $7.4 billion of stocks while selling $25.8 billion.

Berkshire's second-quarter earnings performance was particularly impressive because it had $465 million of foreign-exchange profits in the latest period, against $1.1 billion in the year-earlier period. Those profits reflected the dollar's rise against the Japanese yen, which reduces the value of Berkshire's yen debt. Investors probably should strip out those forex profits from the company's operating results because they are non-recurring.

Berkshire's second quarter earnings benefited from higher insurance underwriting profits, which rose to $1.2 billion from about $700 million in the year-earlier period.

Berkshire's Geico auto insurance business was a key contributor, swinging to an underwriting profit of about $500 million in the second quarter from a similarly sized loss in the year-earlier quarter.

Geico and other auto insurers are aggressively raising prices to offset much higher claims costs, reflecting elevated expenses to repair damaged cars. Geico's premium per policy was up 16.3% in the second quarter, but it experienced a 14% drop in policies in force compared with the year-earlier period. Geico is investing in its systems to better compete against its arch rival Progressive.

Insurance investment income was up to $2.4 billion in the second quarter from $1.9 billion in the year-earlier period, reflecting higher interest income on Berkshire's huge holding of cash and equivalents, mostly U.S. Treasury bills.
Berkshire's Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad business experienced a 24% decline in second quarter operating income to $1.26 billion after taxes, reflecting lower freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating expenses.

Earnings at Berkshire's big utility, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, were little changed at $785 million in the second quarter after taxes, compared with $789 million in the year-earlier quarter.

Berkshire's insurance float totaled $166 billion on June 30, up $2 billion so far this year.

Some are mature companies which don‚Äôt have much growth avenue left and spend their free cash on paying down debt, dividends and stock buybacks. Hewlit Packard (HPQ) is a decent example of this. Also, buybacks will affect dividends by reducing the amount of shares on the market. But yes, for some companies it means they cannot see an opportunity to reinvest at good growth rates and prefer to  ‚Äúlock in‚Äù a return to shareholders by buying back shares.\n\nYou must look at each company case by case and see things like if they are taking on debt to buy back shares and if it‚Äôs sustainable, or are they buying back shares to counteract their stock based compensation.

Even a buy back at fair value is good and a buyback of an overvalued stock could be good or bad. The thing I'm more interested in is if they pay out lots of big bonuses in the form of shares to the top people at the company not long after the buybacks. And if they do that I'd rather get paid a dividend instead of a company I own doing buybacks just to dilute the shares later in the year."", 'I think they‚Äôre second best compared to dividends. Dividends are the best. \n\nBuybacks are great if the company is meaningfully reducing the share count. I like companies that buy back aggressively. \n\nThe ones I don‚Äôt like are companies whose management are fat pigs feeding at the trough, getting too much stock based compensation and then having the company buy back just enough stock to offset their comp. I think that‚Äôs slimey, since it‚Äôs directly just moving money into their pocket and trying to keep it under the radar. Then other shareholders don‚Äôt really benefit.', 'Depends on the business cycle they are in. Not all buybacks are entirely good or entirely bad. A new company should be using their money to expand their business not buy backs. That seems shady. A more mature one can do so because there‚Äôs less to expand and a buyback from the free cash helps increasing shareholders equity. But even at a mature phase I‚Äôd rather prefer seeing a company cutting down their long term debts with the extra cash before they do a buyback.', ""Hard to say yes or no across the board. Some industries or companies trade their own stock to make money and it's a constant thing they do. One way of looking at it is that they see their own company as the best investment compared to what's available for the price. They shouldn't be needlessly looking to spend all their money, it's a business sometimes you get extra cash. So in the end you need to figure out if it's a good thing or not. If it's common in the industry or company you can probably ignore it tbh."", ""It's great when they know they're undervalued and it's more cost-effective to do that instead of pay it back as a dividend or reinvest elsewhere. It's a thoughtful and tax efficient way to give value back to investors, and the price is likely to go up since your shares now own more of the company.

Modern governments print money and buy votes, it's what they do.

Bubble everything is here to stay.\n\nIf you want to invest based on fundamentals, do you mean backwards-looking or forwards-looking? Many investors/traders try to guess forwards-looking fundamentals by both legal and illegal means, which can then start what appears to be irrational movements detached from present reality. If those guesses don't pan out, these same investors will bail on their theses, which can cause another massive seemingly irrational set of movements. Meanwhile, traders who can't stand the irrationally but notice the incredible profit potential from all the noise will try to trend chase with technicals, and others still will try to trade the reversals. Lastly, many funds and persons just blindly buy with every paycheck. And so, all together, even if fundamentals matter in theory, the competitive nature of the market will erode things into a hot mess.\n\nAnd keep in mind, the forex market has huge implications for where persons and funds would want to keep their money, and therefore on flow into equities.

ValueInvesting,Graham's Intrinsic Value Formula (revised in 1974 to include required rate of return) vs. A Newly Adjusted Version?,"I've recently been testing out Ben Graham's Formula for intrinsic value, which is:

**V = (EPS x (8.5 + 2g) x 4.4) / Y**

&#x200B;

* *V = Intrinsic Value*
* *EPS = Earnings Per Share (TTM)*
* *8.5 = Fair P/E for a 0% growth company*
* *g = Projected 5-year Earnings Growth Rate %*
* *4.4 = Yield of AAA Long-dated Corp Bonds when Graham created the formula (Required Rate of Return)*
* *Y = Current Yield of AAA Long-dated Corp Bonds (Risk-free rate)*

&#x200B;

However, I've seen [articles](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/benjamin-graham-formula/) and a [video](https://youtu.be/8jmjxXc5H8c) discussing an updated version of this formula:

**V = (EPS x (7 + g) x 4.4) / Y**

&#x200B;

With the adjustments being:

* *Fair P/E for 0% growth company reduced from 8.5 to 7*
* *Earnings growth rate multiplier adjusted from 2g to just 1g*

From what I understand of the new formula, multiplying the growth rate by a factor of 2 is seen as overly aggressive for modern day growth companies - as high growth rates are much more prevalent now, and 7 is seen as a more realistic P/E for a no-growth company (although one article states that it's up to you to decide which P/E to use.

I am just wondering what people think of the adjusted version of the formula and when should the different versions be used? Should one be used for high-growth companies and the other for lower-growth companies? Please correct me if I am misunderstanding anything.

Once enrolled, your hand is all you‚Äôll need to pay there, Amazon Fresh grocery stores, some Panera restaurants, a handful of retailers at airports, some stadiums and concert venues, and a handful of Starbucks locations.\n\nAt places where the company‚Äôs hand-scanning sensors are installed, you can already use it to enter a venue, identify yourself as a member of a loyalty program, or verify your age at a bar. In the future, you might be able to gain access to your company‚Äôs offices, a parking garage, or a gym‚Äîor sign in at a hospital or doctor‚Äôs office.\n\nAmazon‚Äôs expansion of this biometric technology, which it unveiled in 2020, is an effort to compete with Google and especially Apple in the realm of digital wallets, which are increasingly performing many of the same functions Amazon has in mind for its Amazon One service. \n\nIt won‚Äôt be easy. Despite multiple attempts, Amazon has mostly failed at becoming a payment-services provider, like PayPal, Apple or Square. Apple has spent almost nine years building Apple Pay into a business with at least $2 billion in revenue, and a key way to keep people locked into its iPhone ecosystem.\n\nUnlike Google and Apple, Amazon hasn‚Äôt succeeded at making mobile devices and operating systems, so it is, in essence, trying to make them unnecessary. But Amazon One represents something bigger than payments. It is Amazon‚Äôs most ambitious attempt to become a full identity provider, a sort of universal digital skeleton key that can be tied to pretty much anything else‚Äîincluding, eventually, health records.\n\nDoing all this using a system that identifies you with no device, no card, no other password-like item present is absurdly ambitious. Were Amazon a startup, such an attempt would be laughable on its face. But this is Amazon‚Äîa company with the kind of resources and patience that allowed it to go from being a giant in e-commerce to also being the world‚Äôs leading provider of cloud computing.\n\n‚ÄúThe internet giants have been trying to get more traction in payments for almost a decade, because the size of the prize is not just payments,‚Äù says Harshita Rawat, a senior analyst for payments at Bernstein. Companies that become the identity provider for a person also get the opportunity to sell them other goods and services, and insinuate themselves deeper into their lives in myriad other ways, she adds.\n\nAmazon One‚Äôs expansion so far in 2023 has extended to retailers in nine major U.S. airports and 13 sports arenas. It also is in testing in two St. Louis-area Panera restaurants, said a spokeswoman for the chain. And it is being tested at five Starbucks locations in Washington state and California, said a spokeswoman.\n\nAmazon‚Äôs grand plan\n\n‚ÄúPeople sometimes confuse Amazon One with an alternative method for payments, but that is limiting,‚Äù says Dilip Kumar, the vice president at Amazon who has led the Amazon One project from its earliest days. ‚ÄúThis is more about identity.‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs how Amazon thinks about the problem, he says: Online, there are a lot of good and convenient ways to identify yourself‚Äîfrom device-based biometric password lockers to passkeys. These same systems, in the form of digital wallets, are also creeping into the real world, allowing us to replace everything from credit cards to tickets with just our phones. Amazon‚Äôs real innovation here is taking that a step further‚Äîwhy not eliminate the device altogether, and accomplish all those things with just a wave of your hand?\n\nAmazon says its system has been used more than three million times without ever confusing one person for another, though occasionally it does fail to recognize someone who has enrolled. Kumar says that‚Äôs better than misidentifying a person.\n\nThe underlying technology has been around for more than a decade. It uses near-infrared light to peer through a person‚Äôs hand and capture the unique pattern of blood vessels inside, as well as the surface of the palm.\n\nAmazon says this is secure in two ways. First, the company transmits only an encoded abstraction of your hand scan, in a proprietary format, which can‚Äôt be used to reproduce an image of your hand that could be stolen, even if attackers could get at it. Second, the company says it protects this data with the same systems that protect user data and credit-card information on Amazon.com itself.\n\nPayment networks weren‚Äôt built in a day\n\nPayments, among Amazon One‚Äôs first applications, might also be the toughest nut to crack.\n\n‚ÄúFrom a payments point of view Amazon One feels like a solution in search of a problem,‚Äù says Rawat of Bernstein. In the U.S., she says, neither merchants nor consumers are clamoring for an easier way to pay for things, given that credit cards, digital wallets, and the banking and communications infrastructure that support them are nearly ubiquitous.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of effort by Apple, around 75% of iPhone users, by one estimate, have activated Apple Pay on their iPhones. Yet the fraction of in-store purchases made with Apple Pay is only about 2%, according to a February 2023 report by analysis firm Pymnts. Throw in PayPal, Google and other digital wallets, and that fraction climbs to almost 8% of all in-store purchases.', ""Until there's a data breach and anyone using this now has their biometric info compromised."", ""I'd absolutely love if this was accepted at more places of business. As a consumer, I don't care who owns the platform. I switched from credit card to Google wallet for ease of use and speed. I'd switch to Amazon palm if it was accepted at more places for the same reason."", 'I just want my ID to be my payment method. One card for everything.', '1984 under steroids', '2/ \n\nOf course, an identification system doesn‚Äôt have to succeed through payments. For Aramark‚Äôs sports-and-entertainment division, which runs concessions at many stadiums, Amazon One‚Äôs primary utility has been age verification, says Alicia Woznicki, an Aramark vice president.\n\nConcession sales depend on getting people through the line quickly. Aramark found that after it had optimized other parts of its systems, the main bottleneck was checking IDs. In trials at two concession stands at Denver‚Äôs Coors Field baseball stadium, people who have enrolled can just wave their hand to both pay and verify their age, says Woznicki.\n\nAramark is also testing the technology at the Mission Ballroom concert venue in Denver, where it is already being used for ticketing by a different company.\n\nThis illustrates one of the network effects Amazon is trying to build for its system, says Woznicki: Once a person has enrolled, adding payment information or verifying their age means that such data can be used across the system, no matter what company is rolling it out.\n\nAmazon currently has no plans to connect Amazon One to medical records. But the system could eventually be connected to them, says Kumar.\n\nPrivacy concerns could be a barrier to adoption\n\nNot everyone is happy with the idea of one of the world‚Äôs biggest tech conglomerates scanning everyone‚Äôs hands and storing that data in its cloud.\n\nAmazon One was rolled out at Red Rocks Amphitheater near Denver for a season in 2021. Soon after, the advocacy organization Fight for the Future launched a campaign to end its use there, citing concerns about the security of biometric data gathered by the system, and its potential misuse by law enforcement agencies, says Leila Nashashibi, a campaigner at the nonprofit. The campaign culminated in a letter endorsed by dozens of other organizations and 300 musicians and other artists.\n\nThe division of the Denver government responsible for its venues subsequently decided to discontinue use of Amazon One at Red Rocks. Brian Kitts, a Red Rocks spokesman, says the reason was the venue‚Äôs lack of covered areas, access to electrical outlets, and the kind of fast Wi-Fi the system required‚Äînot the campaign or the privacy and security concerns it raised.\n\nGiven that both Red Rocks‚Äô infrastructure and the Amazon One system have improved since then, and that Amazon has shown the system can work at other venues, adds Kitts, ‚Äúwe‚Äôd welcome the chance to have Amazon One back at Red Rocks.‚Äù \n\nFrederike Kaltheuner, previously the director of the tech and human-rights division at Human Rights Watch, says that what concerns her most about an identity system like this is that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre potentially outsourcing even more infrastructure to a public company.‚Äù While Amazon has pledged to limit its data collection from the system, she is skeptical that ultimately it won‚Äôt give the company ‚Äúhuge troves of data that will potentially be linked back to the Amazon universe.‚Äù\n\nKumar says that Amazon One has been built to gather as little data as possible about its users. For example, when someone uses it to pay for something at a non-Amazon-owned store, the company gets no data about those purchases.\n\nIf Amazon isn‚Äôt getting data from this new system, the logical question is: What‚Äôs the business model to support what could ultimately be millions of hand scanners all over the world? \n\nKumar says Amazon plans to charge merchants and other users of the system a subscription fee‚Äîa detail the company hasn‚Äôt previously revealed. \n\n‚ÄúFor us it‚Äôs a software-as-a-service play,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the device and there‚Äôs a certain fee associated with identity, payments, loyalty, age verification; there are a variety of things you can add onto it.‚Äù\n\nWhat Amazon sees as a virtue of its system‚Äîthat it doesn‚Äôt have to gather our data to succeed‚Äîothers see as yet another potential barrier to its adoption. Merchants are already feeling burdened by the costs of putting in the latest round of new payment terminals, the ones that allow us to pay with our phones, says Rawat of Bernstein.\n\nGiven the wide variety of applications Amazon‚Äôs partners are currently testing with Amazon One, and the additional applications it could enable, it‚Äôs clear the company is in an experimental phase, to see what will persuade places in the real world to adopt the technology.\n\nOnce consumers do adopt this new habit, Kumar says, he is confident it will stick.\n\n‚ÄúOur data show that 95% of the time after people sign up for this and use it,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt go back to their prior way of identifying themselves.‚Äù\n\nEnd', 'Still insane privacy breach, but way better than your palm.

ValueInvesting,"10%'ers and hedgefunds with large positions, how much more than the general public do they know?","Hi,

I was wondering if hedgefunds and other major holders (10%'ers) who aren't insiders have better information on securities than do the general public.

I realize there is firm legislation on trading on insider information, so I am in no way expecting them to know quarterly results ahead of time.On the other hand I'm assuming they have a near direct line to the CEO and the CEO is probably going to be more direct and more honest with them than they are with analysts or the general public, which could lead to them having a better general view of the future prospects of certain projects.

I was wondering if anyone has extra insights for me, or has first-hand experience with these kinds of things.

Both are trained by their respective legal/compliance teams on what constitutes MNPI, so in theory they will not exchange any. However, the PMs are often trained on reading body language and asking questions that are hard to answer so as to get a read on where they think the company may be going. PMs will often ask them to elaborate on their strategy and what kind of metrics they think will show that the company is succeeding or failing to meet their KPI goals.\n\nOutside of corporate access, many hedge funds also purchase ""alternative data"", which is non-traditional market data that gives a view on the market and specific companies. Think buying anonymized credit card transaction data, using a satellite to view activity at a mine, etc. Some of this data can be bought by other investors (and some datasets are basically bought by every leading hedge fund), while some might be from an exclusive contract. This data does not constitute MNPI for several reasons, chief among them that the data rarely comes from a company we may want to trade. One example of where it might is if we buy credit card transaction data from a publicly traded bank. In this case, we may be barred from trading that ticker, or we may have a team behind a compliance wall ingest and process the data and then share it with the front office without the FO knowing what bank it came from.\n\nSource: work at a leading L/S equity fund', ""Versus the 'general public'?

ValueInvesting,Netgear Net-Net,"I came across Netgear $NTGR today as a potential deep value stock. Basically, Netgear produces network hardware for homes and businesses with primary products being Wifi routers and modems. If you live in the US, you have probably used one of their products. This is a cyclical business with relatively flat revenue and cyclical margins/income. So, where is the value?

Assets:
Cash equivalent 203M
Inventories 324M
Current assets 734M
Intangible assets 37M
Total assets 927M

Total Liabilities 314M

So, current assets-liabilities are $420M and tangible book value $576M. The Market cap is $396M. Cash equivalents are >50% of market cap.

Revenue has ranged between $900M to $1,400M over the past decade. 5y average income has been 11M and 5y fcf is basically $0. The previous 5 years free cash flow average of $88M. 

Netgear has bought back roughly 3% of shares per year over the past decade, so there isn't an issue of shareholder dilution. 

The thesis here is that your tangible shareholder equity and current assets exceed total liabilities which provides a large MOS. Netgear is priced at a near worst case scenario, that being the company will not be profitable and the value being strictly in the assets. Netgear's largest segment, wifi routers, is expected to grow 8% per year through the next 5 years and Netgear specifically expected to grow revenue 15% in 2024. 2020-2021 saw a general consumer spending bull market with an unsurprising bear market to follow. When the consumer returns I would expect this market to again benefit from growing revenues and margins. If the company was even able to return to a previous 88M annual free cash flow and maintained a reasonable 14x free cash flow multiple, this could be a potential 3x stock.","['Reading through their earnings presentation, wtf is this NFT art thing and why are they putting their money into making it?', ""I've looked at it today.

ValueInvesting,Psychology in successfully value investing,"I've been a value investor for 5+ years now and doing relatively well.

My experience is that two of the biggest difficulties are psychological;

**Making thoughtful research on an investment before entering**

I'm focused on writing an investment thesis for stocks involving quantitative research (is it cheap?), market research (is there a moat?) as well as other checkboxes & qualitative answers. I've assembled it by reading most books on Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Howard Marks and Mohnish Pabrai.

**Resisting the sell impulse before exiting**

Looking back, most of the times when my thesis is on point - it has been a successful investment. But only if I stay long enough and resist urges to sell before my thesis realises...

I've kept a journal of my investment thesis, my positions as well as the P/L on each throughout the years. It helps me reflect on where I was wrong if a mistake happened, or where I was right. I don't believe there's a systematic approach to win 100% of the times, but there's definitely one to win 51% of the time (including, sitting on my ass and not investing).

I'm curious - how do you write your investment thesis and how do you reflect on investments you've made?","['Write your estimation of intrinsic value and give reasons for it. Stamp the date and give your self a time period where your thesis plays out. \n\nAfter a couple of years, read your note and see if you were correct or not.', 'Ideally you should do a pre-mortem (predicting how it will fail so you can watch for it) and a retrospective (analyzing the results so you can learn from them). You might also calculate confidence intervals so you can see how overconfident you were. I talk about these and other issues in my first book Rational Thinking and Investing.', 'you just need to be willing to hold onto a stock for ten years.', 'About the investment thesis, I write it like a small story (kind of a narrative, as Damodaran says: ""Every valuation has a story behind it"", or something like that) to justify the numbers I come up with (for growth, discount, margins etc.). Once I have it, I try to settle with it and not change very much (or at all) until something really big happens to impact the assumptions I\'ve made about the future. I believe you already do something like that in your researches, so it seems to be a matter of faith in your valuation - and that comes with time and experience, I think.\n\nWhat helps me with the urge to sell is not to look at the stock price very often (ideally, I don\'t look at it at all, unless I hear about something catastrophic that affects the company on the news). This alone helps a lot in sticking to your valuation until its ""due"" date.', ""The human brain is susceptible to panic.

Look at ACN versus IBM for example.  ACN was fully priced but went up 30x from their IPO, IBM was ‚Äòunderpriced‚Äô the whole time it was sinking into a shell of its former self.

ValueInvesting,The case for PagBank (NYSE:PAGS) stock,"PagBank(NYSE:PAGS) is a Fintech company focused on consumers , entrepreneurs and merchants varying in size from micro merchants to medium sized companies in brazil.  
PagBank is the only Fintech company in brazil offering a full ecosystem , composed of both individual digital banking services and merchant acquiring, facilitating both consumers and retailers.  
The company was founded in 2006 and became publicly traded on the NYSE at 2018.  
36.8 percent of the company is privately owned by UOL and  63 is publicly traded with a 3.07B market cap.  
The UOL Group CEO and Principal Executive Officer of PagBank Ricardo Dutra,is the former PagBank CEO (2016-2022) is a part of the UOL Group for 26 years and is a MBA.  
The PagBank Ceo  
Alexandre Magnai is the CEO of Pagbank since 2022 and was in the organization since 2015, before that, he spent 15 years at Mastercard leading their latin american regional new business development and retailer issuers initiatives.  
PagBank is the second largest neo bank in brazil,with its client base growing quintuple-fold in the last 4 years,its credit portfolio growing sevenfold,and total deposits growing tenfold.  
Its payment platform grew from 1 to 11 percent market share in the last 7 years,with 354 R$ Billion TPV in 2022.  
In Brazil, only 55% of population 15+ use credit cards, in comparison to Countries like the US,UK and canada with 88% 93% and 97%,therefore the room for growth is very large.  
Pagbank shows consistent growth,with 40% y/y outperforming the industry‚Äôs 25%, with e commerce being only 15% of total retail in brazil and PCE expected to reach 70% in 2025, PagBank growth potential is further solidified.  
Since Lula was elected in brazil (January first) brazil 10 Year T Bill Interest Rate went down 13%,inflation rate dropped below 4% for the first time since october 2020 and the brazilian Real went up 10% against the dollar, if the economy continues to go along this trend, brazil spending power will increase and as a result the tpv and revenue of PagBank.  
The newly presented 300 Billion $R PAC initiative is planned to create affordable housing and to advance the economy,and while the full bill wasn't unveiled yet and corruption is a viable concern, the initiative could very well help the company to grow .  
Comparing the  key financial ratios of PagBank, to 3 similar companies : Nu Bank(NU),Paypal(PYPL) and Block Inc.(SQ),PagBank has the lowest forward p/e,p/s, p/b, and debt to equity, in addition , it has the second largest net profit margin and largest operational margin.  
The main risk factor in the company is its location,brazil is notoriously corrupt and the current president was involved in corruption scandals before, if brazil economy goes down so does PagBank.

ValueInvesting,Does Market Capitalization Influence Your Buying Decision?,"Does market capitalization influence your buying decision?

Which market capitalization size do you think is best and why?","[""Yup. I think, broadly speaking, small caps are the subset of stocks where retail investors hold the greatest advantage over bigger players like funds. \n\nIf a fund is trying to deploy $300M of capital, they can't deploy that cash into some small cap with a $600M market capitalization and a 20D avg trading volume representing maybe $250k of action. Even if it's by far the best idea on their radar, it's just not gonna happen. Even if they tried to get $100M in, the price would move on them at some point as they spike the volume and certainly after the 13D is out (and it 100% will be out before they're even close to done buying). \n\nMeanwhile, a retail investor trying to deploy, say, $300k, can get their full position bought up in maybe a week of judicious buying without moving the price and without having to disclose their stake. \n\nAs a consequence of the above, proper price discovery tends to be slower in small caps as well. Without an army of analysts and professionals poring over the financials and running things through all their proprietary models, the market is left to set the price using what relatively meager and uninformed trading happens. Many small cap transactions happen as part of a basket; some fund bundles up a bunch of smaller retail stocks, for example, and pitches them to clients or tells them to dump that same basket ahead of a recession, etc. \n\nThe point is that a lot of small cap trading is driven by motivations completely divorced from the actual value of the business. This means that price-to-value inefficiencies are both more common and more exaggerated here than elsewhere. That's a very good thing for a savvy investor. \n\nThen there's the fact that small cap C-suites can often make time to take calls from retail investors. Access to management can yield a tremendous information advantage, after all.\n\nFinally, the growth runways for many small caps are just absolutely massive, meaning an investor who gets it on the proverbial ground floor can often ride a winner straight through to early retirement. Trees don't grow to the sky and likewise the massive, international powerhouses in the large caps and, to a lesser extent, the mature business in the mid caps by definition are further along in their business lifecycles and likely will struggle to generate sustainable explosive growth. It's not impossible, but it is harder to do, and it's even harder to do it without the market catching on and bidding up the price. \n\nMeanwhile, small caps, if they can figure their moats out, have oodles of growth opportunities and runways stretching to the horizon in many cases."", 'Sure.

ValueInvesting,Buy and hold ‚Äòtil death,"I‚Äôve been meditating on investments that you can buy and hold until the day you die.

There‚Äôs obvious ones of course - buying an entire market through an etf - or buying the house you want to spend the rest of your days in. 

But as far as single industries or companies go what do you think will never go out of fashion, and continue rock solid over the next 100- 1000 years?

The best answer I‚Äôve come up with so far is ports. Ports have been around for thousands of years. There‚Äôs no more economical way to transport goods than by water and I can‚Äôt see any technology (short of teleportation) upending that. Ports also service many different sectors (pleasure, trade, and military to name a few). If there‚Äôs a war on - ports still operate, a pandemic - ports still operate (although in a more limited capacity), even natural disasters and the like - they‚Äôre absolutely critical.

What else do you think provides the same long term resilience?","['How would you go about investing in a port in an extremely long-term way?', 'The first form of lending was started in ancient Sumeria around 2000 BC, with financial loans starting in ancient Greece and during the Roman empire\n\n\n\nThere have been all sort of ""disruptors"" (PayPal, crypto lol) to modern banking, but as long as people want to buy stuff they can\'t afford, banks will exist to give them that money ( and for profit). \n\n\n\nStrongly regulated, nationally-crucial banks are forever, namely for me the canadian banks.

ValueInvesting,What do you think when you see a company with a negative Enterprise Value?,"Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash  


The only way a company's Enterprise Value could be negative, is if the value of their cash is greater than the sum of their market cap + debt. What do you think about this?","['I use negative EV as a screening filter. I find some good net nets that way but also a lot of trash.', 'For a while now, I‚Äôve held off on calculating the EV for banks because (i) I didn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs actually useful for these companies, and (ii) I didn‚Äôt know a way to calculate it consistently. Now I‚Äôm still working on answering the first question, but I‚Äôve found a solution I feel comfortable with for the second one so I‚Äôll start with that. As I understand it the EV has three main parts:\n\n> Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash\n\nAnd we calculate it this way because if someone where to look at acquiring an entire company they would in theory need to purchase the equity and debt, and the cash would be transferred to the new owners. So, to get the most accurate value you should use the market values for equity, debt, and cash. But this usually isn‚Äôt possible, and in most EV calculations you‚Äôll only be using the market value of equity (the market cap). \n\nTo skirt around this problem there are a couple ways to report the values of debt and cash, and the easiest way is to simply use the figures reported on the balance sheet. For most companies it‚Äôs fine to make this assumption since the market and book values for debt should be relatively close (with distressed companies being an exception), and the market and book values for cash and cash equivalents should also be close. \n\nBut it must be noted that the EV should equal the companies Operating Assets (Fixed Assets + Intangible Assets + Working Capital). So, if a company needs its cash for its ongoing operations then that cash should be taken out of the EV calculation and put into the Operating Assets column. This distinction between operating cash and excess cash can be extremely hard to make, and in the case of banks it‚Äôs even harder. Then on top of that, some companies may have cash that is stuck and pretty much untouchable. So, to get around these problems you can make a couple compromises: either include all cash in the EV calculation, or set a percentage of revenue as the cash needed for operations and mark all cash in excess to that amount as non operating cash.\n\nThen with that information in hand you can accurately calculate the EV for pretty much any company. But there‚Äôs still one thing left to consider, and that‚Äôs the timing of your calculations. \n\nFor stable mature companies you won‚Äôt see drastic changes in their market cap, debt, or cash every quarter. But even with mature companies those values will constantly be changing, and when calculating the EV you‚Äôll have to decide if you want to calculate the value consistently or if you want to find the most up to date number. And like always there are multiple ways to do either of these calculations, but in short it comes down to if you want to use the most recently reported values (ex. quarterly statements and current market cap) or if you want to use the values at a consistent date (ex. End of year). \n\nThese two methods will give you different results even in the most stable of companies, and when looking at young or growing companies this is where some strange things can happen. As stated before, even the most mature companies will have deviations in their EV. So, when a company has large or unusual changes in their operations it can cause large differences in the EV that may or may not show up depending on how you calculate it.\n\nFor example, say a young company had a large market cap and cash balance at the end of 2022 which resulted in a positive EV. Then in Q1 2023 they had to use all of their cash, and during that time their market cap also dropped. So, if you were to calculate the EV based on the current market cap and the cash they had on hand at the end of 2022 it results in the EV turning negative. However, if you were to use their most recent cash balance (Q1 2023 in the example) then their EV remains positive.\n\nThis is why it‚Äôs important to understand, not just what EV represents, but also the inputs that go into the calculation. So, to answer the question of what I think when I see a negative enterprise value, I don‚Äôt think much of it unless I calculated it myself. Seeing how there are so many variations of this calculation, unless I know the inputs for the EV, it‚Äôs relatively useless to me. And to the people saying that ‚ÄúA negative EV is free cash,‚Äù I hope they realize that there are multiple ways to come up with this figure because it can be extremely misleading. \n\nAnd lastly I‚Äôm a big fan of Aswath Damodaran and I heavily relied on his work, so I‚Äôll link some of his relevant articles below:\n\n‚Ä¢ [A tangled web of values: Enterprise value, Firm Value and Market Cap](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2013/06/a-tangled-web-of-values-enterprise.html?m=1)\n\n‚Ä¢ [Enterprise value is negative... Is that possible?](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2008/12/entperise-value-is-negative-is-that.html?m=1)', 'Either Japanese (so you will never get your money) or most likely a (biotech) company with a multi year cashburn', 'Personally, I prefer enterprise value over market value. Here is why. \n\nIn the concept of Value Investing, one must not see a stock as mere pieces of paper; but, rather, as a portion of a business. When one purchases shares in the business, they are, in effect, owners of said business. \n\nThe person who invests should determine how much they are willing to pay for a company. If one can buy a \r\ncompany for free ‚Äì especially one that allocates capital well ‚Äì that company should be bought. \n\r\nHere is an example of how enterprise value factors into a regular stock. \n\nAs of March 2, 2022, the market value of Coca-Cola (KO) is $271.62 billion. That means that the market has valued the \r\ncompany as being worth that amount. The enterprise value of KO, however, is $298.76 billion. This is \r\nbecause the debt outweighs the cash by $27.14 billion. \n\nFrom a deep value standpoint, I would not be as likely to buy KO because it costs more to purchase and acquire than what the market is valuing is; so \r\nfrom the get-go, one would lose a little bit of their investment. In the case of Coca-Cola, it is a company \r\nwith a significant moat. However, a person focused on acquiring a company, would be less likely to buy \r\nCoca-Cola if it means paying a premium compared to market value. \n\n\r\nSome companies trade so low that the enterprise value outweighs the market value. Take, for \r\nexample, my investment in Ayro in January of 2022. Why would I invest into a company that in 2020 \r\nhad lost $10.8 million? Because the company had a negative enterprise value of $32.65 million. In \r\nother words, all of the company‚Äôs shares could have been bought, the debt could have been paid for; \r\nand, the investor would still have $32.65 million left over to run the company with. It is free money, it \r\nseems. The only downside is that few people have the means to buy the company outright; but still, it is \r\nusually that in these cases, said stock would experience a ‚Äúhiccup‚Äù in price and temporarily increase; a \r\ncigar-butt investment, if you will. \n\r\nIn short, enterprise value is a great way to value a company if you look to buy the company as a whole.', 'sounds good. Depends of course on whether they will blow all that cash,, or return it to shareholders', 'I looked it up btw (Retractable Technologies that is) and it definitely looks interesting considering is occasionally profitable and has done share repurchases.\n\nIf we‚Äôre talking about negative EV in general, the reason companies usually trade this way is predicted cash burn usually due to technology development, though that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case here, the case here is getting scale in manufacturing and distribution of what is essentially seems like a consumer product (plastic syringes). Sure some syringes may be unique and niche markets can create high margin commodities.', 'Depends on the nature of company as to what drives market cap, nature of debt, and why there‚Äôs cash hoard.\n\nEV is only one metric to screen and try to compare companies. \n\nIn the end though, you want a company that can use the least amount cash to provide the most amount of profit sustainably over time.', 'It appears RVP benefitted greatly from Covid and ramped up production to meet demand and now is experiencing a drop.  Per Covid, RVP was a mediocre performer and may be returning to the same.', 'Noob question.\n\nWhy is cash subtracted to get the enterprise value?', 'Buy‚Ä¶\nYou are basically buying a dollar bill at .80c']"
ValueInvesting,OLIN corporation,"OLIN is an American company involved in the production of chemicals and small ammunition (Winchester brand). The business is competitive in a competitive environment, and has significance that extend beyond just its clients, employees, and investors. It can be seen as a way to invest in defense, climate, and consumer products for a reasonable price with strong supporting financials.

Chlor Alkali+Vinyl and Epoxy:
Some of their major chemical outputs come from the chlor alkali process(they are the world leader). This is 54% of revenue. The derivatives of these products are used in water treatment, paper/pulp processing, chemical synthesis(Steel, oil/gas/plastics, organic chemicals), vinyl (building materials, plumbing, car parts), agricultural inputs including fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, food processing, batteries, cleaning products, and Hydrogen.
They also produce epoxy products representing 29% of revenue (one of the world‚Äôs largest producers). They have an economy of scale in North America. Outputs are used for polymer manufacturing, resins, plastics, water purification, adhesives, protective coatings, flooring, electrical laminates, paint, wind turbine blades, and construction. 
The chlor alkali+vinyl division and the epoxy division are based on something called the electrochemical unit (ECU), which is simply the ratio of output that produces the following chemicals: one part chlorine, 1.1 parts Sodium Hydroxide, and 0.03 parts Hydrogen. The business model relates to the financial return the company can achieve from the ECU, and can be summarized by the following statement: what ECU derivative products should OLIN produce that will maximize financial returns?
The chlor alkali+vinyl division and the epoxy division have dozens of products they are capable of producing. The diversity of the products they produce, from construction, environmental, agricultural, chemical, home goods, etc give the company many different options to choose from. This provides investors with an adaptable investment. One year the company could be defined as a building products business, others it could be defined as a water treatment and climate oriented hedge against adverse environmental conditions.
OLIN has the largest Chlor Alkali production capacity in the world, but it is not a monopoly by any means. Competitors in this industry are Occidental Petroleum, Westlake, Formosa, Nobian Industrials, Inovyn, KEM ONE, Shintech, Hunstman, Kukdo, and Kumho Chemicals. Both Epoxy and Chlor Alkali have a high barrier to entry because of the capital investment required, but are nonetheless competitive among these big players. 

Winchester:
Winchester produces ammunition and related components, bringing in 17% of revenue. They have contracts with the U.S. Army to produce ammunition for at least four more years, though these will likely be extended. Winchester also supplies ammunition distributors and a retailers. The diverse clientele list, and deteriorating geopolitical conditions mean that military supplies will see high demand for the foreseeable future. 
The business strategy for this segment is continued focus on government contracts (ranging from federal, state, and local agencies). The scale of the business (and the ability to increase R&D) is a huge advantage because the U.S. government will choose the lowest cost supplier of experimental ammunition. Current government contracts fund the modernization of productive capital, increasing likelihood that Winchester will be awarded contracts in the future.
Winchester is one of the largest small ammunition manufacturers, and they are highly regarded for their quality. But there is international competition including state owned enterprises, holding margins down. High tariffs and embargo‚Äôs on these specific products act as domestic shields to state owned enterprises. 

Financial State:
61% of the company revenue comes from inside the U.S. 
The financial condition of the business in the past two years has been quite good.  Profit margins around 15%, sales at around 9B, 8B in assets, and D/E hovering around one. The balance sheet is ok, but more cash would be nice. They have very little cash and 2.6B debt. SHE is 2.5B. OCF is 1.9B, CAPEX is quite low at 250M for 2.6B of fixed assets. 
The company made a massive stock repurchase in 2022 of 1.3 billion, over 15% of shares outstanding, a good return for current investors, but future investors would find debt repayments more attractive. Most of their debt is in bonds they issued, but they have a condition in the prospectus that these may be redeemed early. The majority of debt comes due in 2027, 2029, and 2030.

Before 2021, the company had two years of losses. This has lowered taxes and improved results in the last two years. The company forecasts lower profits in future, and management has cited declining conditions in the chemical market as the cause. The company is somewhat protected in the Chlor Alkali segment because of the diversified output options, but epoxy is quite vulnerable and the world currently has an epoxy surplus. They also cite the general decline of economic conditions in North America despite not being visible in many industries. 
Sales this quarter are down by 40%, and net income has more than halved. If market value means anything, it will decline too.
EBITDA/Sales of Chlor Alkali was 24%, Epoxy was 14%, Winchester was 23%. Interest expenses for the business are quite low (always less than 500M). The business can easily pass inflationary pressures on to their customer as long as they stay within competitive bounds.

Summary:
	OLIN is not the most obvious place to look for value. A university level of knowledge about chemistry provides investors with evidence that this company has and will continue to be significant to the North American economy despite being relatively unknown. Conservative financing, bleak future short term prospects, necessity in the economy, significance in day to day life, and military importance paint a mixed picture. For long term value oriented investors that picture looks optimistic.","['Are you sure the company wasn‚Äôt over-earning in the 2020-2022 period?

ValueInvesting,"Peabody (NYSE: BTU) is a bargain, right?","TEV: $2.4 billion

ValueInvesting,Impairment - explained through examples,"This week, I have an educational post, instead of a valuation one. It is all about impairment - a fancy term that I'm sure plenty of you have come across.

&#x200B;

As always, here's a video for those who prefer to watch:https://youtu.be/YxF2NLOOv\_8

The post is divided into 4 segments:

\- Impairment of tangible assets

\- Events that lead to impairment

\- Impairment of intangible assets

\- Impairment of goodwill

**Impairment of tangible assets**

Impairment, in the realm of accounting, refers to the **reduction of the value of an asset.**

Therefore, the first thing that we need to establish is, how is the value of an asset being measured, and why is this so important?

Let's start with a simple example. Imagine that there‚Äôs a company named XYZ, that owns a car, but there‚Äôs no employee with a driver‚Äôs license. Well, what can they do with the car? Nothing, but to sell it. So its value is equal to whatever the company can sell the car for, minus the costs that will be incurred in the process of selling. Let‚Äôs assume that this number was $20k. In accounting, this is the so-called ""**fair value less selling costs**""

If the book value is $25k, that obviously doesn‚Äôt represent the fair value, and the car accounting-wise is overstated. Therefore, a $5k impairment would be recorded.

Now, let's imagine that there is someone who can drive it. In this case, the company can also derive value by using this asset. Therefore, the asset has so-called ‚Äú**value in use**‚Äù. How can this asset be used? Plenty of ways. Let‚Äôs keep it simple, and assume that XYZ is a delivery business, and thanks to this asset, the company makes $2k net profit per month. The value of a business is the present value of future cash flows. Let‚Äôs assume that the value in use of the asset is $40k.

So, now, we have two numbers:

* Fair value less selling costs ($20k)
* Value in use ($40k)

On the balance sheet, the car is reported at $25k. So, is there an impairment? Which value should be used from the two above? The answer is - the higher one. That is the value of the asset to the business and that is referred to as ""**recoverable value**"". The company can ""recover"" $40k of value from the asset.

As the recoverable value of $40k is above the book value of $25k --> There will be no impairment.

This so-called impairment test is mandatory and is done at least once a year.

&#x200B;

**Events that lead to impairment**

There are plenty of events that could lead to impairment and they can be grouped into 3 categories:

1. **Change in demand** \- Remember the first example above, where the only option the company had was to sell the car? Well, if there is an adverse change in demand, that would lead to a lower price. So if the company is to sell the same asset, the cash received would be lower, leading to further impairment.
2. **Damage of the asset** \- Imagine if a tree falls over the car and it is now completely destroyed. It can no longer be sold for as much, and it can no longer be used. (Assuming there's no insurance on the car)
3. **Change in legal/economic condition** \- In the second example above, the business was generating $2k net profit per month. If the economic environment changes, and now the business is no longer as profitable, the value in use of $40k cannot be justified.

Although these are simple examples, if you understand this, you can follow the impairment of all physical assets.

Why would a company impair a building? Well, maybe the building is no longer in use, and the market prices declined significantly. Maybe there was a fire that damaged the building.

Why would a company impair inventory? The market prices could decline, it might be due to a flood that damaged the inventory, or it could be that the inventory became obsolete.

**Intangible assets**

Let‚Äôs introduce another company, named ABC, which owns a patent for cutting-edge technology. The company bought the patent from a start-up for $1 million. Based on the internal calculation, this patent will yield significant returns in the future and the price paid can be justified. So, on the balance sheet, there‚Äôs a patent reported with a book value of $1 million.

Recently, a few competitors developed similar technology, and the value of $1 million can no longer be justified. The estimated value in use has decreased and it is clear that an impairment would be recorded.

&#x200B;

**Impairment of goodwill**

Now, let's bring the two companies together. The management of ABC decided that this whole patent cutting-edge technology is just not for them. Instead, they'll buy XYZ, the delivery business that owns a car. After running some calculations internally, they submitted an offer of $50k that was accepted.

So, they‚Äôre paying $50k for buying a car? Can they not buy a car and start their own business? Definitely, but it will take time until they get to the point of earning $2k/month. So paying more than the net assets value of a business is normal. They are also acquiring the customer relationships that XYZ built with its existing customers, the brand that was built over the years. These are intangible assets and some of them can be estimated.

So, on the balance sheet of ABC, there's $50k less cash, and instead, they got:

* Car - $20k (the price if they are to buy the car on the open market)
* Customer relationships - $10k
* Goodwill - $20k

Goodwill is an accounting plug, that explains the entire cash outflow for an acquisition and it only occurs in this event. This is also subject to impairment.

When does it get impaired? When the value of the acquired business has declined and what is on the balance sheet can no longer be justified.

As mentioned earlier, the value of the business is the present value of the future cash flows. If the delivery business starts losing money and is expected to do so in the future, it is difficult to justify the $50k on the balance sheet. So, goodwill will get impaired. Impairment of goodwill is basically a result of a poor acquisition.

The management had certain assumptions, under which the value of the acquired company was estimated, and turns out they were wrong.

ValueInvesting,Is It a Good Sign When Everything Looks Bad but the CEO Increases His Personal Share Holding by More Than 50%?,"Share purchase by insiders is one of the good things to see, but is it a good sign when everything looks bad (revenue declining, negative earnings, negative equity etc.) but the CEO increases his personal shareholding by more than 50%, buying north of $5000,000?","[""Insiders only buy when they believe the company is undervalued valued.\n\nBut it's worth comparing their salary to their holdings. To see how much skin they have in the game, relatively."", ""I'm in the minority here I guess. I don't think there's much actionable signal left in insider transactions, including buys. Believe it or not, there was a time when Form 4's were considered to be just another type of regulatory compliance paperwork. Some smart people decades ago realized that you could probably implement some kind of working strategy around insider moves and of course, success inspires copycats and things just progressed from there.\n\nAs a result, unlike back then, insiders will sometimes buy just to give the appearance of confidence. There's a reason insider buys are most focused upon when the company's future is under the most pressure; people want hope. If a business is out there just crushing it like an absolute superstar, there's less chatter and less importance placed on any insider buys that occur.  \n\nYet, when examined rationally, if one believes an insider buy during times of famine is meaningful, it should be equally meaningful during times of plenty. The reason is simple; if you believe insider buys signal that they have information that makes them believe the stock is underpriced, that should be true no matter how poorly or how well the business is doing at the time of the buy. If a CEO knows his business will almost certainly double earnings next year, it doesn't matter if the stock is trading at a 10 PE or a 20 PE, it's cheap either way. \n\nThere are plenty of instances where lemmings piled in after an overconfident CEO and got crushed. That leads me to the other side of this which is that that overconfident CEO could, in their heart-of-hearts, 100% truly believe they will turn things around or make growth explode or whatever. That doesn't mean they're right, and I think investors would do well to remember that the buy signal they're following came from the same idiot who ran the business into the ground in the first place in many cases. \n\nEither way, insiders know we're watching and how the majority will perceive their buy/sell and it can distort an insider's motivations for any transactions they know will be publicly disclosed.

You can have a company entering a new market with lower margins but that could double the operating income in $$$ terms‚Ä¶', 'Generally no unless I have a strong indication that it‚Äôs going to change in the near to mid term future', 'Every company in the world is a good investment at the right price.', 'Would you rather buy a good company at a bad price or a bad company at a good price?', 'I‚Äôm curious, what you‚Äôd pay right now for Enron?', 'Generally I don‚Äôt discriminate against either.

ValueInvesting,When to sell?,"I just want to start a discussion on when to sell out of a position? 

Of course there is the obvious answer of when your target price or intrinsic value is met, but with the latter, why would anyone buy a company at its fair value. 

By thinking to sell at fair value, you are inherently believing your target price is an underestimate of the real value, and if not, then ur just hoping someone believes the fair value is significantly higher than your estimate and is willing to buy at your estimate, which just sounds like wishful thinking.

There is also the situation where due to certain events such as earnings beat, ur intrinsic value is less than the new fair value once you account for those ‚Äúevent.‚Äù

The reason i want to discuss this is largely because I am in one of the situations above. I bought shares in nano cap profire energy at 1.25 per share and now it is 1.96 after an earnings beat, but this wasn‚Äôt an earnings beat in my eyes and the narrative from management didn‚Äôt result in a change to my valuation of 2.27 per share.

Basically I‚Äôm now at this conundrum where yes i wouldn‚Äôt buy a low liquidity nano cap with only a 10-15% margin of safety, but my valuation is based off a 12% FCF yield which I believe is possibly conservative and 10% may be more apt due to changes in business compared to history and peers. 

By doing this, i get a 2.66 per share fair value or 36% upside which though not as good as my initial 81% upside when buying, is good enough for me to keep half as i have more liquid and more potential upside investments i would rather invest in, but i don‚Äôt need the cash.","['‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go broke making a profit.‚Äù', 'Money market pays 5%. What return do you require to invest in stocks rather than risk free 5%? For me personally, I would need a 12% annual return to be interested and start a new position. This same logic works for my current holdings. I may not want to add to current positions if I see an 8% return but if I could still hold them. If I only see 0-5%, why would I not just choose the risk free option? That‚Äôs my logic atleast!', 'When the company steps in a direction which you think is not gonna lead to a better future.', '>Value investors should plan to completely exit a security by the time it reaches its full value; owning overvalued securities and hoping they appreciate further is a game for speculators. Indeed, value investors should typically begin selling at a 10% to 20% discount to their assessment of a security\'s underlying value -- the exact discount based on the liquidity of the security, the possible presence of a catalyst for value realization, the quality of management, the degree of leverage employed by the business, and their own confidence regarding the assumptions underlying their analysis. Exiting an investment ""too early"" and ""leaving money on the table"" may be frustrating, but it is far less painful than attempting to get out after it\'s too late. Round-tripping an investment -- watching it go up, failing to sell it, and watching it go back down -- can be psychologically unsettling and economically costly. Disciplined selling, on the other hand, can open opportunities to exit your position and then possibly reinvest back into a company you already know well at an improved price.\n\n- Seth Klarman Foreword to Security Analysis 7th ed.', '""As soon as you\'ve pumped the stock on at least 7 YouTube fireside talks and podcasts"" - Mohnish Pabrai, 2023', 'This is a question that you will get different answers from everybody, mainly because everyone‚Äôs starting point, aspirations, risks appetite and motivation are different.\n\nI am looking for that answer myself and I recognise that the answer may work only for me. \n\nHere are three scenarios that I am toying with:\n\nA. If I had sold my winners when they were overvalued, I would have realised my gains and probably slept better. But I would have missed out on many companies that grew fast, plateaued for a year before continuing its growth again. Eg. Facebook or Chipotle or even Amazon. \n\nB. If I had not sold any of my winners when they were overvalued, I would be a nervous nelly like I am now, where three (!) stocks are 52% of my portfolio, the top five stocks are 67% of my portfolio, and the rest of the other 13 stocks are just 33% of the portfolio. \n\nC.

ValueInvesting,What‚Äôs your stock evaluation checklist and resource for searching for data,"I was wondering if people had a checklist for certain metrics/criteria a stock should or must meet before making a decision. If so, what resources do you use to get that info that isn‚Äôt overwhelming.","['Now this is a fun one. I use annual reports for data and a screener called TIKR. Honestly it was good, but they took the copy and paste clipboard away so I‚Äôm probably not going to renew with them.\n\nScreener:\n- US based (not required, but preferred)\n- Net debt / (EBITA - Capex) <= 1\n- ROE >= 20%\n- ROIC >= 20%\n- dividend > 0\n- Price/book value per share < 5\n\n1. Does the company have durable competitive advantage(s)? Or is it a price competitive company whose profits will erode as margins are compressed over time? If yes, describe it in as simple a manner as you can, as you would to a seven-year-old child. If you can‚Äôt explain it to a child, then the durable competitive advantage probably doesn‚Äôt exist. If you can‚Äôt find a durable competitive advantage, keep your power dry until you do, and until then, wait.\n\n2. Do you understand how the product or service works? If you don‚Äôt understand how the product or service works, you will never be able to determine the chances of it becoming obsolete. Product obsolescence is a real and legitimate fear. If you can‚Äôt explain it, forget it, and find a business you understand.\n\n3. . If the company in question does have a durable competitive advantage and you understand how it works, then what is the chance that it will become obsolete in the next twenty years?\nWill customers and clients likely be using this product or service in twenty years? If yes, continue, if not, stop and start again another time.\n\n4. Does the company allocate capital exclusively in the realm of its expertise?\nYou want a business that knows its game and stays there. If it is a conglomerate, you need to know whether it has acquired other businesses that have durable competitive advantages or has diversified a group of weaker price-competitive businesses. If it looks like a great business or a great collection of good businesses, continue, if not, stop and start again another time.\n \nIf the company is a conglomerate, list the businesses it owns that have durable competitive advantages and are price competitive. Figure out which direction management is headed. Is management allocating capital to buy more of these wonderful durable-competitive-advantage businesses, or is it fixated on price-competitive-commodity businesses?\n\n5. What is the company‚Äôs per share earnings history and growth rate?\nIf it is consistently strong, continue the analysis. If there is a weak year or two, you need to ask whether this is a onetime event or something that will become the norm. Research, look up articles over the said year and review quarterly and annual report to determine If it is a onetime event, then continue. If weak or erratic earnings are routine, then stop your analysis. If earnings appear consistently strong, you should gather the company‚Äô per share earnings for the last 10 years and calculate its annual compounding growth rate for that period.\n\n6. Is the company consistently earning a high return on equity?\nA company that doesn‚Äôt earn a high return on equity over the long term at a sufficient rate of 15% or greater doesn‚Äôt constitute an investment that will return the desired results.\n\n7. Does the company consistently earn a high return on total capital?\nThe reasoning here echoes what was discussed on Return on Equity. Unless management shows that it can get a consistently high return on capital, the company is not worth looking into any further.\n\n8. Is the company conservatively financed?\nFor a company to pull out of any business difficulties it may encounter, it needs plenty of financial power. Companies with a durable competitive advantage usually create such great wealth for their owners that they are debt-free or close to it. Debt/Equity paints a poor picture of the businesses‚Äô strength in that shareholder equity is seldom used to repay debt. The earnings power of a business I the only real measure of a company‚Äôs ability to retire or service it‚Äôs debt. How many years would be required to pay off all the long-term debt?\n\n9. Is the company actively buying back it shares?\nThe repurchasing of shares below intrinsic value increases ownership in a company without the shareholder having to invest any additional principal. Take the number of shares outstanding 10 years ago:, subtract from it the number of shares outstanding in the current year.\n\n10. Is the company free to raise prices with inflation? \nIf the company‚Äôs product is selling at the same price as twenty years ago, then you are more likely dealing with a commodity business and should give it a pass. If the price of the product has risen on an average of at least 4% a year over the last 20 years, you can be absolutely sure it‚Äôs the kind of business that can command prices in excess of inflation.\n\n11. Are large capital expenditures required to update plant and equipment?\n\n12. Is the company‚Äôs stock price suffering from a market panic, a business recession, or an individual calamity that is curable?\nThese types of situations usually offer the best prices. If you can‚Äôt buy during one of these events, then you are probably paying full price for the stock. A bad news situation should be exploited if the intent is to take advantage of the market‚Äôs shortsightedness.\n\n13. What is the initial rate of return on the investment and how does it compare to the return on risk free investments?\nTake the company‚Äôs current owners earnings per share, and divide It by the current price of a single share, This will give you the investment‚Äôs initial rate of return. Then compare the investment‚Äôs initial rate of return and expected growth rate per share to the return being paid on US Treasury Bonds. If the treasury yield is higher, the stock is overpriced.\n\n14. What is the company‚Äôs projected annual compounding return?\nTake the company‚Äôs median/average ROE for the last 10 years using owner‚Äôs earnings. Then subtract the average or median percentage that is not retained, and is paid out as a dividend. Use the resulting difference as a rate of growth that the company‚Äôs book value will grow.\n \nUse the company‚Äôs book value per share in the current year as the present value, and use the calculated annual rate of growth for book value for 10 years. This will calculate the per share book value of the company ten years out.\n \nTo determine the guesstimated price of the company‚Äôs stock ten years out, take the company‚Äôs future per share book value and multiply it by the average return on equity. Then, multiply the projected earnings per share of by the company‚Äôs lower or average or median P/E ratio for the last 10 years on a quarterly basis: This will give you the guesstimated company‚Äôs per share future trading price. \n \nDiscount the estimated future value to the current using a discount rate no lower than 15%. Then take 80% of this figure to establish a margin of safety to buy at or below. This is your line in the sand.\n\n15. Do you make the buy?\n\nDoes the estimated CAGR at your 20% margin of safety or lower, based on the future price, support your desired minimum CAGR or return target? Is it likely this level of return can be supported by the fundamental and qualitative factors of the company in addition to its current market price level? Do earnings without dividend support the return level? If all answers are generally satisfied, proceed with the investment decision.', 'As a start i take Peter Lynch recommendations such as Debt/Equity <1, high cash reserves, PEG < 1.', 'My process is very fluid depending on company type and situation, i mainly use filings and tikr.terminal for company level data.']"
ValueInvesting,How Do You Know if a Stock Price Drop Is a Market Overreaction or a Rational Reaction to Fundamentals Deterioration?,"Recently, a growth company‚Äôs YoY sales growth has slowed down from 25% to 18%. That caused a 25-percent stock price drop. Isn‚Äôt that drop justified by the slow down in growth, considering that the PE ratio was 57x before the recent results?   ","['The S&P is trading a [multiple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/stocks/peyields) of around 20. So, if a company is trading at 57x, that\'s nearly 3x the market, which implies that investors are clearly pricing this as a growth stock. So, if for whatever reason, growth does not materialize, a lot of investment theses will have to be revisited. And if investors are paying 57x earnings and expecting 25% growth, I\'d argue that given any sign of a slowdown, they\'re likely to sell first and come up with justifications later.\n\nHowever, as someone had previously mentioned, it depends on why revenue growth came in lighter than expectations. Is it a one-time solvable event, such as a delay in getting parts from a supplier that\'s likely to be resolved, or is there something that\'s structurally changed in the industry, such as, new competition, changing consumer preferences?\n\nIs the drop justified given the high PE?\n\nIt\'s hard to say. If the market always knew that x% revenue decline should be matched with a y% decline in the stock, then stocks would always be efficiently priced. But we often see over/under-reactions.\n\nThat being said, slower growing companies do get a lower multiple. \n\nSo, what you\'re seeing is repricing that\'s being driven by multiple contraction as well as lower cash flows (resulting from the slower than expected sales growth).\n\nOn top of that, we\'re in an environment where investors are putting higher importance on growth. (Just think of how the ""magnificent 7"" have led the market due to AI growth hype). So, the flip side of that is companies that are showing weakening growth seem to be getting taken behind the woodshed\n\nJust some general thoughts. Hope that helps.\n\nTLDR: High multiple stocks tend to crash when growth slows down; but it\'s hard to know exactly how much of the decline is justified vs. how much of it is an over-reaction', 'I think this is a thing that will keep happening with growth stocks, at least for the forseeable future, as management teams shift away from taking on debt.', ""Depends on why that drop in revenue occurred. If the company is cyclical or exposed to consumer spending habits, then the company should recover eventually. If the company is losing business to competitors, is too niche, failed to expand globally, or has faced some kind of backlash, then it can be a cause for concern. You'd have to listen to the company's earnings call and see what excuse they come up with and then decide if you believe them or not."", ""Hard to answer, Mr Market isn't rational and is prone to mood swings. But beware of high-fliers with high-PE ratios, they can drop A LOT on bad news... but if the growth trend is good, the business has a moat, a good brand etc. that kind of a pullback can be a good buying opportunity. But which PE are you talking about being 57 btw? Current, Forward 2023 or Forward 2024.   \n\n\nHonestly, it's happening quite a bit in the market the last few days, unless we're in the same company (O-I Glass), it also dropped 20% but a smaller growth slow down than 25% to 18%.

ValueInvesting,Netflix Stock Analysis,"Hey everyone! This post is going to breakdown Netflix. I am going to provide a detailed overview of the company and then find out if it meets our four investment principles *(Circle of Competence, Competent Management, MOAT & Margin of Safety).* This is a very long post because I want to explain my rationale. This analysis is going to be broken down into four sections:

1. History/Overview of the Company
2. Qualitative Analysis
3. Quantitative Analysis
4. Buy Price

**History of Netflix**

Netflix launched in 1998 as an online movie rental service. When Netflix began, they offered a subscription package allowing members to rent as many movies as they want for $19.95. The deal was that Netflix subscribers can keep DVDs, up to three at any one time, for as long as they wish. At the time, Netflix's largest competitor was Blockbuster, and funny enough, Netflix offered to sell their business to Blockbuster in 2000 and Blockbuster rejected the deal.

This turned out to be a huge mistake for Blockbuster because Netflix forced Blockbuster into bankruptcy. How did Netflix go from offering their business to stealing consumers away from Blockbuster? There are four reasons which I will break down but the overarching answer *is that Netflix just offered far more favourable options to consumers at a much lower cost.* Let me explain.

* *Better deals:* Subscribers can order a movie online with next-day delivery. Netflix subscribers were able to hold on their DVD as long as they needed without late fees. When it's time to return a movie, a subscriber puts it back into the postage-paid mailers that came with and drops it into a mailbox with no shipping fees.
* *Forward thinking:* Netflix was investing in technology and consumers really liked the personalised recommendations by their software (*Netflix recommends titles based on user's previous choices).* Brick and Mortar stores like Blockbuster relied on *store clerks who knew nothing about their customers' movie tastes*.
* *Lower operating costs = better value for consumers:* In 2004, Netflix's logistics systems included *only 30 distribution centres throughout the United States.* A typical Brick and Mortar store like Blockbuster would take more than 500 video stores to serve the Los Angeles area, while Netflix *served the same market with only one warehouse.* Because of lower operating costs, Netflix were able to pass on those cost advantages to consumers, offering subscription rental around 50% cheaper than same-store subscription rental.
* *Online streaming:* Netflix invested in online streaming since they recognised that video-on-demand was gaining popularity. *Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010.*

**Overview:**

Netflix is one of the world‚Äôs leading entertainment services with approximately *238 million paid memberships in over 190 countries* enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Netflix is available virtually everywhere except in China and Russia. Members can play, pause, and resume to watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

While consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of ‚Äúwinning moments of truth‚Äù. In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members, we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.

**Qualitative Analysis:**

Reed Hastings is currently Chairman of the Board and is the founder of Netflix. Reed Hastings has a history of purchasing Netflix shares indirectly and has a good compensation structure. 

There is no doubt that Netflix has a lot of competitors. They compete against linear TV such as broadcast and cable television and other video streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Disney/Hulu, Youtube, HBO. However, Netflix does hold competitive advantages:

* *Linear:* Netflix is much more flexible over linear TV. Netflix is not competing for scarce time-slots whereas linear TV present programs only at particular time. Netflix is on demand, whenever someone wants to watch a show.
* Netflix produces their own content with their own studio and this is becoming a major source of Netflix: *There is an argument that states Apple and Amazon does the same. Firstly Apple TV is operating at a loss in that segment and is relying on its more profitable lines to make up for that segment. Amazon Prime recently started operating at a profit however there are a few things worth noting.*

1. Amazon Prime memberships are available in only 27 countries, whereas Netflix is available in over 190 countries. Furthermore, *Amazon is very diversified so they have a limited focus, whereas Netflix's only focus is providing entertainment to consumers.*
2. Netflix has a successful track record of producing local stories to reflect the different tastes in different countries and made them available and popular worldwide. Think of Netflix originals such as Money Heist (Spain), Squid Game (South Korea), Alice In wonderland (Tokyo, Japan). Without Netflix, a lot of international series and movies would have never achieved global penetration.
3. Netflix original films bypasses the Cinemas and Netflix gets original access: This also makes Netflix a competitor to theatres, except that *theatres have limited seats and time slots, Netflix does not.*
4. Furthermore, Netflix licenses from other studios in the first pay TV window (the ""pay one"" window). This means Netflix gets first access after theatrical release of licensed content. Pay-one movies debut very well after theatrical release with a lot of viewership and Netflix has the ability to carry the film for 18-24 months. The result: Netflix has more viewing time than their competitors.

**Quantitative Analysis:**

Although Netflix has a bigger market share compared to other streaming platforms (some countries Youtube has the lead), Netflix market share is just under 10% so there is still significant room to grow.

This is where it is important to pay attention when it comes down to valuing Netflix. At first glance, it looks like membership growth is decelerating from 20% growth to under 10%. However, there are a couple things to consider. 

* Last year, Netflix stock price plummeted due to losing memberships in Q1 and Q2. When Netflix reported losing -0.2 million subscribers in Q1, this was because they withdrew there services from Russia that resulted in a -0.7million impact on paid net adds; therefore, excluding this impact, paid net add would have been +0.5m. 
* At the time, Netflix just announced paid sharing and there was a lot of initial negative reaction with consumers deleting their Netflix accounts. However, this turned out to be temporary and Netflix subscriber growth quickly improved after that. (One thing to keep in mind is this: *20 years ago, people were paying $5 for a single new rental DVD release, and around $60 for cable. Back then, the general cost of goods and services aren't anywhere like it is today due to inflation.* ***People will always pay for entertainment, so Netflix paid sharing impact on subscriber growth was always going to temporary.***
* Netflix has entered into the advertising business and so far it is proving to be successful. Consumers are benefitting because of lower price points, Netflix is benefiting because of increased subscriber growth and the advertising segment has better margins. 

How did I calculate Free Cash Flow? 

Netflix pays a substantial amount each year for content and it is hard to determine what portion of that content spend is considered maintenance capital expenditure and what portion is considered growth capital expenditure. To make this process easy, I have calculated free cash flow by taking:

* Cash Flow from operations + Additions to Content Assets - Amortization of content Assets - Purchases of Property & Equipment = Free Cash Flow. 

I also believe that this is a conservative estimate of Free Cash Flow because amortisation is on an accelerated basis. Over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is amortised within 4 years after it first becomes available. There are tax laws preventing management from speeding up depreciation of tangible property but since intangible assets such as content is extremely difficult to measure, management can speed up the amortization process. ***Management is incentivised to do this because a higher amortization expense (which is a non-cash expense) reduces the amount of taxes Netflix has to pay!*** 

**BUY PRICE:**

If you made it this far in the post then congratulations üòÇ üëèüéâ . My buy price ranges from ***$182 to around $250.*** I have used the discount cash flow calculator using the current year free cash flow (2022). The former assumes a growth rate of 15% with a 15% discount rate. The latter assumes a growth rate of 10% with a 10% discount rate. 

&#x200B;

I'm spewing I missed out this opportunity to buy last year but I have only looked into Netflix this year. If you gained some knowledge from this analysis and want to show any support I welcome you to subscribe to my Youtube channel. You can find this on my profile.

ValueInvesting,STMicroelectronics at a glimpse,"STMicroelectronics is the second largest EU company in the semiconductor industry. They are shifting their focus more towards the automotive industry, where they service both of the two large areas, namely the chips needed for charging and those needed for automatic driving. They have competition, but they each serve only one of the two areas. Besides the automotive industry, when it comes to their chips, they are recognized as a top company, with a great presence on conferences. I know this as I work in a tangential field, with close friends working directly in the field. It is said that other companies software for designing circuits does not compare as well.

Under the EU chips act, they got funding for building another factory in France. They are also building a new factory in China in tandem with another company. Details can be found in their last Q report.

Currently, a lot of their business comes from the USA, from companies like Apple and Tesla. Given that they are building a factory in China, and the current tensions between USA and China when it comes to import, I am unsure how this will affect existing business with the US.

They regularly perform buybacks
TTM income is up 11%, and almost doubled in the past year. The balance sheet looks good, with negative net debt. They are trading at around 10 PE, which is low both for the industry and their history.

Given their China deal and the overall market conditions, how it reacts to earnings, they can still fall closer to their 52 week low. As such I am waiting for the opportunity when the price drops a bit lower still. I will probably sell puts at a lower price, to collect the premium while I wait.

I would appreciate any thoughts on the company, the sector and their value.","['China will copy there tech, and replicate it. Consequence of setting up in China.

It seems that most countries plow billions into chip production thus creating overcapacity in the industry which usually leads to low returns for shareholders. However, maybe they occupy an attractive niche or sth and are therefore isolated from looming oversupply or maybe demand will outpace the supply growth.\n\nThis question about supply made me stay away from semis. I would much more like to see companies closing down factories."", ""Personally I'd prefer Infineon over STM based on their market dominance in power semiconductors and their balance sheet, although they trade at a higher PE. But that doesn't mean STM is a bad investment; a lot of EU chippers are at or below fair value at the moment.

ValueInvesting,"Live Nation (LVY) and new tracker stock, Liberty Live Group (LLYVK)","Barron's recently ran an article titled, New Liberty Live Stock is Cheap Play on Live Nation (8/4/23).  The article asserted that the new tracker stock, Liberty Live Group (LLYVK), was trading at a \~35% discount to the asset value of Live Nation Entertainment (LYV).  Liberty Live Group owns a 30% stake in LYV.

LYV has a market cap of $20.2 Billion.  If you subtract out debt of $900M, you have a value of $19.3B.

LLYVK's 30% stake in LYV should equal $5.79B (= 30% x $19.3B).

LLYVK has a current stock price of $34 and \~70M shares outstanding; so a market cap of $2.38B.

Question:  Why does Barron's state that LLYVK is trading at a \~35% discount to LYV when it looks like it is trading at a \~59% discount?  What am I missing?  Am I miscalculating this?

Even the filing on Liberty Media's website suggests the carrying value at 6/30/23 for Liberty Live Group was $6.4B  ([https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/508/liberty-media-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2023](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/508/liberty-media-corporation-reports-second-quarter-2023)) ","[""I've looked into the numbers again, it's around a \\~33% discount as of today. Current LLYVA/B/K market cap is around 3.2 BN with an Enterprise value of \\~4 BN. The Market Cap value of LYV that LLYVA/B/K owns is is \\~6 BN. Since there's around 800 mm of net debt in the stock tracker -- assuming we assign 0 value to all of the other assets -- the implied value of LYV is the market cap of LLYVA + net debt of LLYVA, which equals around 4BN. Compare 4BN to the actual market value of LYV (6 BN), and you have around a \\~33% discount.\n\nThe stock looks intriguing (like any other Liberty tracking stock, tbh), your choice to invest should probably depend upon whether you're comfortable underwriting the actual LYV stake at the implied LYV share price of $58.19/share. The company at first glance looks like a growth stock and therefore its future value has variability; whether the stock is appropriately valued would require deep analysis.\n\nNote that these things have traded at a discount for eternity, so don't expect these gaps to close any time soon."", 'Not sure, but if you‚Äôre looking into LLYVK you should take a look into LSXMK, which I feel is an even better deal relative to the underlying asset.

However, after the recent spin-off and restructuring of the assets and tracking stocks, LSXMK represents a different asset than it did back in May .... now it represents simply an 83% interest in SIRI.  \n\nAs the Barron\'s article also highlighted: ""Barron‚Äôs calculates that the current discount on Liberty SiriusXM tracker is about 40% relative to the value of its 83% stake in SiriusXM, less about $2 billion of debt.""  This calculation also begs a similar question to my first question posed:\n\nSIRI is trading with a market cap of $18.88B.  Subtract out the $2B of debt mentioned in the article .... Arrive at a value of $16.88B.  An 83% stake of $16.88B equals $14.0B.\n\nLSXMK, the tracking stock for SIRI, is now trading with a market cap of $12.93B; so where is the 40% relative to the value of the 83% stake????\n\nCan anyone explain these anomalies? \n\nu/cinchegatherer34 I agree with you that SIRI and LSXMK could merge in the future and shareholders of LSXMK could profit from such a corporate action.', 'I honestly believe what you‚Äôre saying is exactly why there may be such a huge discount and it being so overlooked.

ValueInvesting,HelloFresh stock analysis and valuation - One of my largest positions,"This week's casual valuation is **HelloFresh**. I've received many requests to cover it as it is one of the largest positions in my portfolio (13.5%.

In this post, I'll share everything that there's to share from my side, but please do not treat this as financial/investment advice. If you want to make any decision, please do your homework.

As always, a link for those who prefer to watch: [https://youtu.be/SLs8LwqsSRg](https://youtu.be/SLs8LwqsSRg)

The post will be divided into the following segments:

* Introduction
* The business model
* Historical financial performance
* The balance sheet
* The 2025 target (provided by the management)
* Assumptions & valuation
* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine

**Introduction**

For those who are not familiar, HelloFresh is a company operating in a niche market. It is a direct-to-consumers company, that delivers meal kits & ready-to-eat meals.

**A meal kit** is a combination of a recipe and all the ingredients required to make the meal. Once a week, the customer can choose the recipes, and everything gets delivered in a box to their doorstep.

**A ready-to-eat-meal**, is well, pretty much the same, except there's no cooking to be done.

Other than its own brand HelloFresh, it has acquired other smaller companies in the past, such as Factor\_, Green Chef, Chef's Plate, and YouFoodz. These are companies that operate in the same industry, and the company uses its know-how to scale them up, by increasing capacity, but also expanding in other countries.

Other than selling meals, it also sells soups, desserts, bakery products, salads, etc.

A tiny portion of their revenue comes in the form of fees for including some marketing material of other companies (offering discounts for example) in the box sent to the final customer. This is not a significant portion, but the margins are 100%. Adding a couple of flyers in a box doesn't take that much space, and other companies would pay to target a certain geographical area for their products/services.

&#x200B;

**The business model**

The company operates based on a pull model, meaning the first step is done by the customers, choosing the recipes, and placing the order. Between that day, and the delivery (in the Netherlands, the deadline for ordering is Wednesday, and delivery is being done during the weekend), HelloFresh:

* Orders all the ingredients
* Gets all the ingredients delivered to their fulfillment centers
* Orders are being packaged & sorted for delivery

There has been a lot of investment done in automation in advanced assembly lines, so the fulfillment centers are in pretty good shape.

The capex reached its peak in 2022 and is expected to decrease every year over the next 3 years. The main reason for this is the infrastructure that is already in place as it is sufficient to support ‚Ç¨10b in revenue (the last twelve months' revenue is ‚Ç¨8b).

There are 7.1m customers (assuming 1 customer = 1 household), representing roughly a 2% penetration rate, comparing it against the 322m households in the countries where the company operates. A high penetration rate should not be assumed, as this is a very niche market.

&#x200B;

**Historical financial performance**

The company has roughly ‚Ç¨8b in revenue (vs. ‚Ç¨4.3b market cap), with a gross margin of 26%. The direct costs are related to:

* Ingredients
* Packaging
* Delivery

After taking the marketing & G&A expenses into account, the operating margin is around 3%. So, why would I invest in a company of this kind?

I expect the margins, and the free cash flow to grow. Here's my rationale:

If you take a look at the 3 direct costs, it can be argued that **ingredients and packaging** will grow hand in hand with the more orders the company has, leading to higher gross profit, but same margins.

However, **delivery** doesn't grow at the same pace. Imagine if one of their vans needs to transport 10 packages to one neighborhood, Now, if the same van has to transport 12 packages, the cost would not increase by 20%. The van has already made the majority of the journey.

This means, **the more customers there are in a certain geographical region, the higher the margins are**. In the mature markets where the company operates, the operating margin is between **8%-10%** (in some, the operating margin is even 12%, but this is too high to use for long-term assumptions).

I am a customer of HelloFresh, this is how I got introduced to this public company. If someone is happy with the product/service, there's no additional marketing expense required to keep them satisfied. Therefore, I expect the marketing expense to decrease as % of revenue over time. The management shared the 2025 targets, and we'll come back to this.

&#x200B;

**The balance sheet**

The company has almost ‚Ç¨0.5b in cash, which is solid, with very low accounts receivable (‚Ç¨17m) which is expected, as the customers pay almost at the same time as the delivery. This means the company has almost no risk of not getting paid.

In addition, as there operate in order cycles, they hold very little inventory (‚Ç¨250m), consisting of fresh ingredients and packaging materials.

On the other side of the balance sheet, it is worth mentioning that they have around ‚Ç¨0.7b in debt, including leases, as they lease some of the fulfillment centers in the US, Sweden, Canada, Australia, and the UK.

&#x200B;

**The 2025 target**

The management shared the 2025 targets, and the summary is as follows:

* Revenue growth to ‚Ç¨10b
* Gross profit 26% --> 29%
* Marketing expense (as % of revenue) 18% --> 16%
* Operating profit 3% --> 8%

Today, we have a company with low profitability and high capex (to increase its capacity), and as of 2024/2025, we'll have a company with modest profitability and much lower capex. Based on my assumptions, I expect a significant increase in the free cash flow.

&#x200B;

**Assumptions & Valuation**

However, only because the management has certain targets, doesn't mean that is exactly what is going to happen.

My assumptions are more conservative:

* **Revenue growth** of 5% for the next year, reducing to 2.5% over time (the ‚Ç¨10b revenue target of the management is hit in 2028)
* **Operating margin** slowly improving, reaching 8% in 2027
* **A discount rate** of 8.7%

After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of HelloFresh is roughly ‚Ç¨6b (‚Ç¨34.5/share).

For comparison, the company's market cap is ‚Ç¨4.3b (‚Ç¨24.5/share).

Based on my assumptions, the IRR that the company offers is **12.7%.**

For those who are interested in multiples, based on my assumptions, at year 10, the terminal value is multiple of the FCF at year 10 x 17.8.

&#x200B;

**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**

Of course, the future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.

&#x200B;

|Revenue / Operating margin|6%|8%|10%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|40% (‚Ç¨10.8b)|‚Ç¨23.0|‚Ç¨32.7|‚Ç¨41.3|
|51% (‚Ç¨11.6b)|‚Ç¨23.9|**‚Ç¨34.5**|‚Ç¨43.5|
|100% (‚Ç¨15.4b)|‚Ç¨27.7|‚Ç¨41.4|‚Ç¨53.7|

The ‚Ç¨34.5 is the fair value based on my assumptions. If you take a look at the sensitivity, for example, the 6% operating margin column, there's not that much difference if the company grows by 40% over the next decade, or by 100% (‚Ç¨23.0 vs. ‚Ç¨27.7).

However, if you take a look at the first row, the valuation changes significantly. As this is a low-margin business, one of the main tasks of the management is to expand margins.

Therefore, the main risk around the company is its margins. If the management doesn't succeed to expand the margins, the impact on the valuation is significant.

My rationale is that as the company gets more customers in the existing geographical regions, the costs per order will decrease. In addition, the reduced marketing expense (as % of revenue) and reduced capex will increase the FCF significantly over the next two years.

I appreciate all the support that I get here and on the YouTube channel.

But about 75% of the time we lost the whole box because they packed it poorly, lost our money, and it just ADDED a ton of stress to our lives instead of removing it.\n\nWe canceled our subscription and won‚Äôt ever be using it again.

Assuming the company has a lot of debt (probably the reason why it has negative equity), the company can easily pull back the dividend to pay off debt obligations. \n* The company uses free cash flow to re-purchase its stock or uses a combination of free cash flow + debt to fund an acquisition. Similar to above, the company can stop share-repurchases and use excess funds to pay down debt. \n* The company has a high ROIC and a high interest coverage ratio (operating income/interest expense). A high ROIC makes sure that debt+equity is generating a good return on investment. Otherwise what's the point taking all that risk with debt. That's a losing game. A high interest coverage ratio tells you that company operations can cover the interest. When it comes time to pay off the principal, the company could pay it off if it has enough cash balance. Otherwise, it can take on additional debt to pay off existing debt. However, this approach is a little more risky. \n\nI would buy if these criteria meet.

One interesting thing when I perform the research, most of the website tends to forget the subtile rule of Mathematics that -1 x -1 = 1, so when performing the Graham Number calculation, **take the sign of BVPS and EPS** into account ! 

Antother big mistakes is to look into ADRs companies ! Where the price is in $ and the financials are in local currencies.

&#x200B;","['Wasn‚Äôt the Graham formula intended to show that fixed formulas to calculate intrinsic value are junk?\n\nMy understanding is that since the 2nd edition of securities analysis, a lot of the context was lost. And this formula was not intended to be used as an accurate way of valuing a company, rather it was meant to demonstrate why you shouldn‚Äôt use a single formula.', 'Avaialaible (seen at the bottom of the article) is spelt Available \n\nAnd the link does not render\n\nOtherwise - nice representation. Perhaps talk about how the formulas Graham developed changed over time?', 'He developped differents rules that can be translated into mathematical word, and one of them is the Graham Number which is the summary of the 2 rules : \n\n\\- PE <15 \n\n\\- BVPS <1.5 \n\nSo the formula combinates both constraints and you get a nicer ""view"". I\'ll not speak about a fixed formula as the Graham Number is more a ratio between an ""intrinsic"" price and the current price. As other rules, the defensive approach should have a Graham Number in % >1. But not is the enterprising approach. \n\nPersonnaly, I think all rules are logical, but the Graham Number give us a way to rank companies.', '>Available\n\nYou are right, thanks for the typo ;) ! About the link, maybe Reddit or lack of Metadata, but it was not the purpose to share the blog, but start a discussion. \n\nYes, it definetely changes overtime, mainly due to inflation.

Companies with consistently high ROE, ROIC, and depending on what they do (product vs service) high ROA and inventory and AR turnover?\n\nPersonally I use owners earnings against price to determine a yield of return. This is just a spot check to see if it warrants further evaluation, but a simple one. If at todays share price the earnings of the company available to ownership provides an insufficient yield (in my case below 15%), especially when taking the last decade of median and average ROE, P/E, etc. into account, that tells me if the price is right or not to support my targeted CAGR. Because if I were to buy the company outright today at the share price x total shares, I would pocket the earnings as the owner. That would be the immediate earnings as a return on the price paid.\n\nP/E to me just says what the market would pay for it, especially when considering the median P/E over the last 10 years of quarterly financials so you have 40 data points minimum. \n\nBook value per share is a good indicator as well. A solid entry for just about any firm, but it doesn‚Äôt tell you the book yield or growth of book value over time. Does that make sense? I know this is over simplifying, but focusing on undervalued as well as meaningful earnings and dividend growth that support compounding returns in the long haul. I know the Graham formula had a growth multiplier, but I think it‚Äôs better to use the average and median ROE,  and retention or payout ratio of said company over the last decade as growth rates. Especially if the financials are very consistent and you‚Äôve identified durable competitive advantages that will keep said growth going at a similar rate.', '>Book value per share is a good indicator as well.

And Graham came with one interesting but general approach.', 'That‚Äôs a really good point. He was working with what he had at the time. And he had very good methods for his day. Its pretty difficult to apply a blanket standard to all, But it‚Äôs pretty close regardless. And Graham was not saying hey guys this is the end all be all, you‚Äôre right the context was just simple concepts and not intended as the final and only method to comprehensive analysis. \n\nI really wish there was a lot more video of Graham‚Äôs lectures and exercises than what‚Äôs out there to really give some solid context. I feel there is a lot of other insights he had to offer that didn‚Äôt make it into writing.\n\nIt was really Buffet who expanded on the approach when he got tired of cigar butts and one hit wonders. And quite honestly he built upon Graham‚Äôs principles and made adjustments.\n\nFor us today, we can also take these concepts and further make adjustments. At the end of the day we‚Äôre all utilizing shade under a tree planted by someone else and just redecorating here and there under said tree.

Hence negative net income but extreme growth rates. In those cases looking at gross margin and adjusted earnings metrics allow you to see how the core business is doing and take out the impact of aggressive reinvestment in growth.\n\nFor example Monday.con would have a 30 PE ratio if they fired all their sales and marketing tomorrow.

SecurityAnalysis,Darden Restaurants 2037 Bond,"
This is going to be a short write-up mainly because I am lazy, though if you have any questions/comments, I‚Äôll respond in appropriate depth.

Darden restaurants is a casual and fine dining operator with a portfolio of brands containing the following well-known restaurants: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar‚Äôs Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, and Eddie V‚Äôs, with them just recently acquiring Ruth Christ.

They are the largest company in their space, though unlike their QSR peers, they focus on expanding and investing company-owned and operated restaurants, not on franchising, though they do have franchisees as a result of acquired companies pursuing franchising, it is a non-core focus and not part of their core strategy.

For the next twelve months, they should produce 1.6B in operating cash flow roughly or 1.8B in EBITDA. Maintenance Capex including replacing estimated stores that will close is 315M for the NTM with 260M in planned net restaurant expansion capex for 43-48 net stores to be added to its base of over 1900.

They currently have, besides operating leases which are already expensed in EBITDA, 5 debt profiles, 2027 bonds, 2035 bonds, 2037 bonds, and 2048 bonds, along with a 600M Term loan for its recent acquisition total 1.54B in long-term debt obligations excl. associated interest. They also have finance lease liabilities of 1.2B with 44M of interest in 2023 FY ended May 31, 2023 making total interest expense 125M-130M for FY2023 likely (term loan is floating).

Ok now that we are done with the business/financial expose, the thesis here is on the 2037 bonds which over the last 15 years have been bought significantly in open market repurchases due to their high 6.8% coupon with the current amount left being 42.8M from the original 300M face value.

Though DRI is BBB rated by S&P/Moody‚Äôs, they are unreliable and with the BBB spread at 150BP to 180BP on treasuries, these bonds should at surface level be trading for 5.75% to 6.0% YTM, yet they are at a very attractive 7.40%

Now lets go a bit deeper, these bonds were issued in 07‚Äô and due to the company being half the size then and a bunch of acquisition occurring at once, an amendment was added which in the case of credit downgrade below BBB, the coupon could be increase up to 2.000% from 6.80% coupon, but it can‚Äôt go down below 6.80%, where it is currently. This offers a pretty nice safety net.

The other important thing is that even though the credit rating agencies are rating them BBB rn, they are full of crap. The 600M floating rate 3y term loan issued for the Ruth Christ acquisition has a interest rate of any Term SOFR + 1.10%, a spread only given to companies rated A/AA as of now. the 2027 bonds are also trading at 5.46% YTM or 100BP spread and 2035 which are similar to the 2037 in question at 6.15% YTM, and the 2048 at 5.80% YTM or 140BP spread.

I‚Äôm not sure why the 2037 bonds are trading at the highest spread of 340BP and their only unique nature is the credit deterrioration addition which is only a positive, and with open market purchases and the non-callable nature, liquidity is pretty acceptable. It is probably liquidity tho but the 7.38% YTM was on August 16th and there is a couple of trades 3every few days, so liquidity isn‚Äôt bad, especially for the 42.8M in remaining face value.

I think a yield of 7%-7.40% is an absolute steal for bonds of A/AA company that is the only aggregator in its industry and has reliable cash flow with FCF of 1050-1150 for the NTM including growth capex equivalent to a FCF/Interest coverage ratio of around 8x-9x!!","['Is this a writeup on DRI or an op-ed on credit rating agencies?', ""I think the cyclical nature of the restaurant business is probably what's reflected in lower credit rating. The agencies typically limit their ratings for cyclical industries. \n\nTypically anything less than $500M is pretty illiquid in the credit market, and those eye popping yields are probably dealer gouging retail traders. If you can actually buy at >7% then I think its a good trade"", 'Lol, it‚Äôs relevant mainly because the credit rating is based on wider industry woes which Darden routinely has a fair margin above.\n\nI mean credit rating definitely isn‚Äôt everything, but compared to sell side equity research, SS fixed income is usually worse due to a broader industry focus rather than individual fundamentals.', 'Yeah, makes sense considering the liquidity is small.', ""I'm not knocking it , if it's supposed to be commentary on ratings agencies, to be clear. But I don't think it's fair to call it A/AA rated when it isn't. Just disagree... But, like, WMT is AA rated. DRI is not that."", 'Ok i understand, yeah i def overstepped calling it AA, my bad. i would say more like A- then, i just think at current leverage (2x) and business model, BBB/BBB- doesn‚Äôt make sense and isn‚Äôt reflected in their term loan spread and spread of the other 3 bonds.', 'Otherwise, well thought out and I agree for the most part. But my biggest hangup is that they don\'t have any concepts that I personally eat at and that\'s a ""my portfolio"" thing not an actual problem lol']"

SecurityAnalysis,What‚Äôs your opinion on liquidity discount for small caps?,"Basically this is something I have seen a bit looking at valuation/analyses of companies online in the early 2000s, and I wanted to spark a discussion on the reasoning for/against the use of a liquidity discount. 

I just want to first cover some of the popular rationale for a liquidity discount. Usually the major point is of course in the name, liquidity, being that for many micro caps and small caps, in order to exit your position, you are likely to have to exit a large position at what was previously less than market price or you‚Äôre an investor that due to circumstance (say a mutual fund), values liquidity and the ability to sell out of a position in a day without losing a significant amount of value. 

The other main point I‚Äôve seen is really just the positive correlation between illiquidity and volatility of stock price which kind of relates to the previous point but is different. 

The context for me is my investment in Nathan‚Äôs Famous (NATH) who has a great business model built by a moat on protecting and expanding their IP while monetizing it through licensing, food distribution, franchising, and company-operated restaurants. They have a low beta of 0.20, of course beta is market-relative volatility but the low volatility is clear, giving a cost of equity under basic formula of 5.70%, if you adjust debt and keep utilized ERP, it is still 8.20%. It has average liquidity of 14k daily or about $1M daily which I think is enough liquidity for a 300M MC company that no liquidity discount is needed and an 8% to 10% discount rate seems reasonable to me, but besides business stability which is definitely there, how much liquidity discount should there be, or should there even be one in mine and similar cases?","['Business valuation professional here. Liquidity discounts are not warranted in this context, but practitioners usually apply size premium over and above capm. For 300 mm mcap company size premium would be about 2%-3%. Also betas for smaller and less liquid stocks are noisy.  Check your beta estimate against comparable companies, 0.2 seems too low.', 'Having given this a cursory read, I would say $1MM daily liquidity is enough to not warrant a significant liquidity discount.\n\nWhen I think liquidity discount I think of those companies that trade maybe $50K worth of shares a day and they have a $50-100MM market cap.\n\n$1MM is enough that a HNW individual could build a position over the course of a few days and not even really move the company.', 'I think dissect whether it‚Äôs liquidity due to small size (fund restriction on buying), which the company would have to rectify by growing larger‚Ä¶ or undermarketing themselves to investors. Either way, its hard to understand the investment opportunity‚Äôs without a definite catalyst - i.e, being added to a new stock index, reached a market cap size that exposes them to small cap funds, or company investing more into investor marketing activities.', 'Yeah i check against a better source and it was still 0.25. I adjusted the Rf to cost of debt for it to see what would happen and kept the ERM constant getting me a 250BP premium over the CAPM or 8.19%.\n\nUsing the average of 8 comparable companies, i got a representative beta of 0.66 resulting in 8.05%, similar to just substituting cost of debt for rf.', 'Okay, thanks for the insight!', 'Yeah I thought of that and one of the things that also makes them pretty great for a small cap is their management that has pretty great capital allocation.  They are former PE (literally bought the company in their PE days and made the great business model in place today) and have done special dividends to return capital (2015, 2017, and 2019) using debt and non-dividend distribution tax treatment, along with opportunistic buybacks (they want to preserve liquidity but acknowledge signficant discounts), and also have a pretty sizable regular quarterly dividend ($2 yearly, 40% payout roughly).\n\nI mean they are getting 12M-14M in post-dividend FCF each year growing as the business grows, they have 48M in net debt (80M debt, 32M cash), that means that in 3 years, they will have zero debt as they already have redeemed debt in March 2023 and coupon is slightly below market currently. \n\nBy that point, they will have 35M in retained earnings and they will probably do another bond issuance of 120M-160M at a fair rate, 35M will be a qualified dividend, and then the rest will be a non-dividend distribution and due to IRS treatment as ROC, it will just reduce cost-basis and not be a taxable event. \n\nManagement has a pretty good incentive to do this considering current insider ownership by former CEO/Chairman (24%/70M) with that being around half or a third of net worth.\n\nSo yeah the catalyst is direct shareholder return through regular dividends, buyback, and special dividends.']"

SecurityAnalysis,Royalty Pharma (RPRX),"Hey sorry for the short post, but I just felt that even though I am just starting to research RPRX, I would like other people to know about them as the opportunity seems clear. 

Edit: This is a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) based out of Ireland for IP and taxation reasons. Due to the US-Irish tax treaty, American shareholder of RPRX must choose, when reporting taxation, as a Qualifed Elected Fund (QEF) selection or be subject to excess distribution tax regime. IF u elect to be a QEF, you will be taxed on your share net capital gains and ordinary income, and if not, all income and capital gains will be taxed at ordinary income rates, no matter holding period, though the capital gains can of course be deferred until share of sales unlike the QEF Selection.

Royalty Pharma buys royalty interests in late stage or approved/marketed pharmaceuticals or biotech products, and holds them until patent/royalty expiration. Due to increasing R&D in biotech/pharma, they will be able to capitalize on the pharma industry funding partner as they have in the past, they have deployed over $20B+ in cash and have made up over half of all biopharma royalty transactions, but they are most definitely not price takers and though they target low teens IRR on their investments, though they have routinely beaten their conservative royalty income targets.

They IPO‚Äôd in June of 2020 at a pretty high valuation of roughly 20x-25x earnings post-warrant and share rights adjusted, at a valuation of 20B+ at their peak. After issuing extremely low interest rate debt  of 7.3B at an average coupon of 2.25%, they were able to maintain this premium valuation until the beginning of this year.

As of right now, the 2023 estimate for cash receipts or royalty revenue is 2.95B roughly, and with a 90% EBITDA margin, they are trading at roughly 8x EV/EBITDA. Though the portfolio WA life is 15 years, long-term growth of royalties is expected in this time in between LSD and MSD. 

Of course there is also a value to their investing platform as if they structured this as a perpetual capital private equity vehicle, I have no doubt they could charge 2/20 given their track record and with a good fund size. But even if we prescribed no value to the platform and just let the royalties run off, this is a steal.

The fact is that we can assume maintenance capex by looking at the average 13 year, 13% IRR target investment and realize we would need approximately 40%. Given 1/MOIC at the end of 13 years, we get a margin of 35%-45% (I‚Äôll need to create a sensitivity table based off IRR tho). Thus we can consider cash flow margins of roughly 50% giving a yield of 7.60% which is growing 3%-4% annually, which is extremely attractive as the industry R&D expands meaning more opportunities for investment, along with new more effective technologies possibly having higher approval and go-to-market rates.","['Can you elaborate more on what you mean by ‚Äúmaintenance capex‚Äù? Is this the amount that would need to be reinvested in new deals to maintain current levels of royalty revenue?', 'Yep, thats just my rough estimate based off historical and target IRR where if you assume average life of 13 years and the assumption that once patent expires, no more revenue is generated due to generic competition/entry, though of course that last part is very conservative and actually never occurs, but still it makes sense to model cash flow that way, and I think the company forecasts drug sales to drop off to negligible amounts upon patent expiration.\n\nThe weird thing with that 13 year number is that each drug royalty‚Äôs end time is based on a variety of things including royalty changes at a certain date or generic competition due to patent expiration. It is possible they are being too conservative with the end case though I expect them to try to be as say you underestimated, then you invested too much back into a business that is highly profitable and worth it over share repurchases/dividends, and if you overestimated, then your kind of screwed cuz you already distributed the money, it really just makes sense to always invest back as long as your not price taking.', 'It is just my very rough estimate btw and they seem to be estimating that they will invest more. Their 5-year capital deployment range is currently 10B-12B, with it being 7B in 2020 which is around the current maintenance needs, so they are on track to invest in their business more than needed which is great considering the high ROI.\n\n\nPlease refer to this presentation for more accurate numbers than mine which were written quickly without double checking: https://www.royaltypharma.com/static-files/18601454-e1e6-4765-abff-d457cc35e474']"

I came across this interesting article which broke down the bill of materials for a regular vs NVDA DGX H100 server. It basically shows that in AI servers, the % of the server cost consisting of GPUs increases from 0% to 72%, but the % consisting of the other components decreases by a lot.   
  
Yes, component ASPs will increase as we need more advanced components for AI servers, but not nearly as much as the cost increase for AI GPU chips.  
  
So I was wondering, assuming most companies' IT budgets are somewhat fixed - as companies purchase more AI servers at the expense of regular servers, do you think that AI server sales will cannibalize the sales of server components like mother boards, cooling systems, power supply, etc?",[]

With the trade surplus rarely more than a few percent of GDP, it cannot lift the economy by itself for more than a short burst. Plus, it remains to be seen what will happen to the surplus in the coming quarters.\n\nThese figures add up to signs of classic short-term burst, of the type we‚Äôve seen for the past three decades, not the signs of a turnaround.

Those models, in turn, formed much of the basis of forecasts that implied a recession was necessary to get inflation under control. Yet over the last year, we have seen a rapid expansion of the US labor market‚Äîwith nonfarm payrolls increasing by 3.8M and prime-age employment rates hitting 20-year highs‚Äîcoinciding with significant deceleration in wage growth, spending growth, and inflation.

Wallstreetbetsnew,"The ""Straw"" that ""breaks"" the Camel's back","Not sure how many of you have read about the US Debt downgrade, but this could be the catalyst for a major turning point for the World.

If you are thinking how does this affect the World or the World Investments, then below is a brief flow of thoughts -

1. Debt downgrade because already highly indebted and running fiscal deficits.
2. This forces US to reduce deficits and even try to run surpluses.
3. This would also mean trying to restict the growth of debt and possibly even paying down the debt with time due to inflation (inflation makes debt cheaper and easier to pay down, but it also means INFLATION).
4. Low growth or no growth in debt means no growth in economy (excluding growth in say exports).
5. No growth in economy means possibly no growth in the World.
6. The World is affected because if US is reducing debt, USD gets stronger, which means higher import cost for the World, which could loosely translate to higher fiscal deficits for the World too.
7. So if the World also has to reign in it's fiscal deficits, they would have to work on degrowth, if not, they would have to raise interest rates too to make the currency stronger against the USD, so fiscal deficit is managed.
8. But raising rates means slow down in the economy.
9. If you claim that certain countries (like India) have scope for massive growth, you need to think that for this growth to be realized, people need to have access to money or to job opportunities that provide them money.
10. Job opportunities are created when there's money, money is created when there's job opportunity, and so is the cycle (more or less).
11. So money needs to be introduced for growth, but if interest rates are higher then introducing money becomes tougher, and if interest rates are lower then read points 7, 8, and 9.

The above are my superficial thoughts. This is not a Econ 101 list, so please read everything with a spoon of salt. The idea to make this post is to have a flow of ideas, thoughts, and debates.

With the US Debt downgrade, I am having a lot if internal thoughts and debate, and in times like these, I feel the best way is to have an outlet for your thoughts and ideas, and to debate them. The more ideas and thoughts are struck down, the more the residual ideas and thoughts are pure.

Wallstreetbetsnew,Paving the Path for North America's Helium Independence: Total Helium's (TOH.v) Strategic Leap,"With escalating demand for helium across a range of sectors, including medical applications and technological advancements, Total Helium (Ticker: TOH.v) is strategically positioning itself to play a pivotal role in North America's journey towards achieving helium self-reliance.

TOH is making significant strides to solidify its position in the rapidly expanding $4 billion helium industry, having experienced 12% share price growth over the past 5 days.

https://preview.redd.it/1bilwym8ycib1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=a89c239033d07b49c78a604efea007fa8422fd98

Central to the company's growth strategy is its 50% ownership in the Pinta South Helium Field, situated within Arizona's Holbrook Basin.

In this area, TOH has successfully conducted drilling operations for 15 wells, yielding initial results that exhibit helium concentrations of 8.11% and 8.22%‚Äîa substantial increase compared to the typical concentration of 0.5%.

Out of the total 15 wells drilled, seven have recently become operational, while the remaining eight are in varying stages of integration into the pipeline network.

Covering an expansive 27,000 acres, the Pinta South field offers numerous prospects for expansion, all at a cost-effective rate.

Envisaging a potential scenario of 300 wells at an average cost of $220,000 per well, the ongoing drilling efforts, combined with the field's promising composition, create an ideal environment for efficient helium extraction.

To reinforce its market presence, TOH has forged a strategic partnership with Linde PLC. Linde PLC is not only providing financial support for the pipeline extension but also committing to purchase helium from the project's initial 10 wells.

Wallstreetbetsnew,Exposing A Scam: The Case For Shorting Primerica ($PRI),"TLDR: Primerica is a publicly traded pyramid scheme that has recently had attention brought to it by youtuber Always Marco through a 1M viewed video that was taken down. His video‚Äôs viewership has likely caused many complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and negative attention which will likely result in a drop of the stock price, which will only continue if we can actively bring more complaints and attention. 

Intro

I want to preface by saying this isn‚Äôt an attempt to create some trendy meme short. This is a genuine evaluation of a company engaging in deceitful and harmful marketing and selling tactics that negatively impact poor people, and simultaneously creates no value. There is also a predictable catalyst that will negatively impact this stock, which a coordinated community can exploit, especially when the company‚Äôs practices are generally viewed in a negative light by the average person who‚Äôs even vaguely familiar with how pyramid schemes work. 

Always Marco Takedown

[Always Marco](https://www.youtube.com/@AlwaysMarco) is a youtuber who makes videos and documentaries exposing pyramid schemes. He currently has over 85K subscribers, and is affiliated with popular youtuber [Coffeezilla](https://www.youtube.com/@Coffeezilla) (3M subs), someone who he also is in contact with occasionally, as Marco has mentioned in his livestreams. 

On July 15th, 2023, Marco released a video his fans had long waited for, an expos√© of a multi-level marketing company named Primerica. In less than a week, the video amassed over 900k views, Marco‚Äôs most viewed video and a catalyst for his recent sub growth. By July 24th, the video had been taken down, preceded by a livestream by Marco stating that he had been targeted by copyright strikes and privacy complaints from Primerica. His Instagram account has also been taken down. 

The full video is available here: [https://www.kapwing.com/videos/64bfceaf7ecf64005f898a83](https://www.kapwing.com/videos/64bfceaf7ecf64005f898a83)  

In the video, Marco eloquently explains why Primerica is a pyramid scheme, the main point being that the best (and essentially only) opportunity for a new agent to make money is by recruiting other agents from which they receive a portion of their commission, along with an increase in their own commission after recruiting a certain number of people. He also directly addresses common warning signs of a pyramid scheme [from the FTC website](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/multi-level-marketing-businesses-pyramid-schemes#pyramid) (that Primerica takes part in), including emphasis on recruiting, high pressure sales tactics, and extravagant promises of earning potential. 

I believe that the takedown of this video (as well as all of Marco‚Äôs videos and livestream covering Primerica) will eventually result in a case of the Streisand Effect, hopefully perpetuated by posts like this one sharing his now-deleted video. 

We can help bring awareness to this cause, bringing to people‚Äôs attention the exploitative nature of the company. This in turn, will increase the number of complaints filed on [the FTC‚Äôs site](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/#/assistant), a simple process where you can report the situation of how you or someone you know were exploited by Primerica. For reference, [MLM supplement company Vemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemma) was shut down in 2015 after only 170 complaints, a tiny number in comparison to the total number of victims, as about 40,000 people leave Primerica every year (agents have a 99.7% failure rate). 

I would like to hear ideas and opinions. Together, we can form a group that reaches out to victims, brings awareness to the issue, and brings forward legitimate complaints to the FTC, to bring down Primerica. Perhaps we could reach out to existing notable groups already exposing fraud, such as [Hindenburg Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_Research). I do think this will be a long-term play (1-2 years), but it is a tentative idea for the moment. ","['IMO Primerica being a pyramid scheme isn‚Äôt news. It‚Äôs been a pyramid scheme.

Wallstreetbetsnew,"Do we still lose money here, or is it all memes these days? Calls on $LYFT","Hey hey it‚Äôs me, haven‚Äôt posted since the $HTZ $GME $AMC days. 

Anyways, since all of you work at Wendy‚Äôs and can‚Äôt afford a lambo yet, I know you‚Äôre familiar with how shitty rideshare apping has become. 

Those of you who have no tendies know what I‚Äôm talking about because Uber or Lyft bangs you on the way to work everyday. 

Those of you who have tendies, congratulations. You also know that Lyft is banging you because it‚Äôs really hard to get consistent rides. The cancellation, ridiculous surging, poor driver matching etc. 

Unfortunately my tendies disappeared and my hot wife is banging one of you carpetmunchers. Not to fear, I bring you news that may help us go from Wendy‚Äôs to Lambos once again. 

As a poor tendie-less trader, I too have succumbed to the poverty job that is driving for rideshare apps. I‚Äôll get to the point, things have gone from bad to worse for Lyft. If you lurk r/Lyft and r/lyftdrivers, you‚Äôll notice both parties are complaining. The issue is this: Lyft is drowning. In a last ditch effort, they are absolutely banging both drivers and riders harder than my wife bangs her boyfriend. Fares are double what Uber charges for the same ride, while at the same time driver pay not only decreased, they announced the end of surge pay!

*Gee iamemperor86, sounds like bankruptcy to me, why the call to purchase Calls?*

Because dimwits, you think Lyft is just going to disappear? At some point in the near future, Uber or another 3rd party will buy them out. It‚Äôs a company that‚Äôs literally too big to fail. Think of the prospect of it from the Uber standpoint, they‚Äôd become a monopoly again. 

Compare Ubers market cap vs Lyfts. Happy investing.

Technical analysis:

We finished the 11 Aug, in very big engulfing green candle after a Doji with (+5.70% Uptrend),

The trend should continue with a nice demand zone on the 16.5$,  


RSI after the massive candle on friday is still super low 19.38.

CCI Went from -651 to -88 in a couple of days meaning now it's a good time to buy in.

Volume went up massively on friday (especially in the after market).

Call/Put ratio is heavily on the call side meaning the market believes this stock is undervalued.  


Suspicious foreign activity might have heavily shorted this stock (we will see that on the 15th Aug short ratio report)

On 2-Aug someone shorted for 3,848,659 Shares (On that day alone)

So the Average Short Price is on 16$  for  385,000 Shares only that day, right now the price is 15.23$ and the Average volume on this stock is 1,173,019 Shares a day.

Meaning that if the price goes above 16$ a lot of alerts for short losses will start to pop up, which means a potential volume of  3,850,000 shares will inflow back to the stock.

This does not include the shorts that were taken the following days.

&#x200B;

Some Shorts (not a lot compared to the volume) have started being covered at the end of the trading day in highly unusual volumes for this stock. (indication of ‚Äòbuying on market‚Äô is the sky rocketing RSI - Never happened on that stock before)

I was frustrated with the terrible news reading experience (Paywall, advertisements) so I created a free tool that summarizes the latest news articles and analyzes the potential stock impacts.

It has saved me so much time to help me understand which news might be more important than others.

It's completely free. However, AI is a blackbox so use the rating (positive, negative, long-term, and short-term impact) as a reference.  It may have picked up some nuances within the article to give a rating and you might not agree with it.

Wallstreetbetsnew,Rapid Advancements: Total Helium (TOH.v) Initiates Operations Utilizing 15 Wells in Pinta South Project,"With escalating demand for helium across a range of sectors including industries, medical applications, and technological advancements, Total Helium (Ticker: TOH.v or TTLHF for US investors) is strategically positioning itself to air North America's drive for helium self-sufficiency. TOH is proactively advancing to fortify its stance within the swiftly growing $4 billion helium industry.

TOH's ownership stake of 50% in the Pinta South Helium Project, located in Arizona's Holbrook Basin, is a crucial component of its developmental goals.

Recent operational updates from TOH highlight progress made in the Pinta South project within Arizona's Holbrook Basin. Noteworthy achievements include the completion of a six-mile pipeline and the interconnection of five wells to the helium processing facility.

Presently, seven out of the total 15 wells are actively producing helium, while the remaining eight are in varying stages of completion. Upon integration with the pipeline, these supplementary wells are projected to amplify helium production, consequently boosting revenue.

Total Helium retains a 20% working interest in two wells, and a 50% working interest in the remainder. To facilitate pipeline expansion, the company has forged a collaboration with a leading multinational industrial gas and chemicals manufacturing firm, which is contributing to funding.

Wallstreetbetsnew,Rite Aid - Good or Bad?,"Hi All,

Firstly, I have bought options because in my opinion a squeeze could happen with this stock.

1) it has a high short interest of 23%
2) there is momentum for this stock - according to a news article below there is high interest in out of the money calls. 
3) company has scandals and is burning money but management is doing something to turn this around.
4) the debt-equity ratio is high also giving you the benefit of leveraged equity. Meaning that an increase in revenue disproportionately affects equity in a positive way.
5) good candidate for a merger or takeover

Downside:

- scandals, company has engaged in horrible scandals like selling fake prescription drugs. Invasion of privacy of costumers and data leakage.
- sold their golden geese. Most of their profitable stores have been sold to Wall Greens. 


I would like to hear your thoughts about this company, short term and long term. Again, whether you like or dislike this company it is the perfect candidate for a squeeze.","['Your ‚ÄúDownside DD‚Äù isn‚Äôt at all accurate. Rite Aid never sold fake prescription drugs.

Wallstreetbetsnew,Palantir #PLTR Earnings Release: A Crucial Event for the Palantir Community,"Palantir Technologies is gearing up for a highly anticipated earnings release tomorrow, making it the most crucial event in the company's history. Expectations are soaring, and the results are poised to impact the company's share price significantly. As the financial world eagerly awaits the numbers, let's take a look at the key benchmarks that Wall Street analysts will be watching closely.

* **est. EPS: $0.05**
* **est. Rev: $560 mln.**

**üíº Revenue Growth:** Wall Street analysts are eyeing a substantial 18% year-on-year revenue growth for Palantir. This translates to estimated revenues ranging between 550 and 600 million USD. Achieving this growth would be a strong indication of the company's ability to expand its market presence and capitalize on new opportunities.

**üìâ Stock Based Compensation (SBC):** One crucial factor to watch out for is the SBC, which should ideally remain unchanged from previous years. Even better, a decrease in SBC quarter by quarter would be perceived positively by investors. This indicates a responsible approach towards managing expenses and a commitment to maximizing shareholder value.

**üìà Client Expansion:** An increase in the overall number of clients will be a clear sign of Palantir's continued success in attracting new business. Reducing client concentration, where the top 20 clients dominate the company's revenue, would be another positive development. By diversifying its clientele, Palantir can strengthen its position in the market and reduce potential risks associated with over-reliance on a few customers.

**üíº Strong Balance Sheet:** The company's balance sheet will be under scrutiny, particularly its cash position. A cash position of over 3 billion USD would be highly encouraging, as it signifies stability and financial strength. Furthermore, an improvement in Free Cash Flow would demonstrate that the company's operations are generating healthy cash inflows.

**üåê Geographic Revenue Expansion:** Investors would also welcome an expansion in Palantir's geographical revenue distribution. A reduced reliance on the US market and a broader international footprint would mitigate potential risks tied to regional economic fluctuations and regulatory changes. Diversification in revenue streams could lead to a more sustainable growth trajectory for the company.

As the earnings release approaches, the Palantir community eagerly awaits the outcome. The company's performance against these benchmarks will undoubtedly shape its trajectory in the market and have a significant impact on its stock price.

What do you expect from Palantir and its earnings release?

The revamped website is more than just a cosmetic upgrade. Each privacy and security solution now boasts its own comprehensive mini-site, offering a detailed breakdown of its features and functionalities.

Wallstreetbetsnew,KAVL Swing Trade Idea,"Good morning everyone! I am bringing you a favorable risk:reward setup shorter term trade setup on KAVL this morning. Communicated disclaimer, NFA. This chart is relatively simple, but my analysis will be below it. I hope youre having a wonderful Wednesday!

So, let's begin with the price targets:

1. **.4749**
2. **.4946**
3. **.5287**
4. **.5871**
5. **.6813**

I chose these price points due to larger buy/sell blocks, support and resistance, and supply/demand zones...as well as some more technical levels - like, points of interest, etc.

Additionally, the **RSI** is currently oversold. This indicates that a reversal could be starting soon.

The diagonal white line is a longer term resistance trend line. I believe that if we break above that (we are likely to get rejected at it) then KAVL will go on a LONG term uptrend.

In conclusion, I am bullish on KAVL & I really like this low risk/high reward setup. Tomorrow I may give a brief rundown of what the company does fundamentally, too.

The data license  agreement will  provide  Phillips Brewing with a fully automated data  intelligence tool   delivering real-time analytics, insights, and  forecasting  capabilities  at the liquor retail store level as well as the   first-of-its-kind  industry-level performance and positioning   insights.¬†Fobi will generate  revenue from this deal through monthly   license fees.

**FOBI'S REAL-TIME ANALYTICS TO PROVIDE PHILLIPS BREWING WITH IN-DEPTH MARKET INSIGHTS & ENABLE DATA-DRIVEN DECISIONS**

Traditionally,   many breweries have little insight into the movement  of activity for   their shipment data, which causes brands to continuously  stock more   inventory or ship more products without fully understanding  what that   looks like on a transactional level. As a part of this new  agreement,   Fobi will provide Phillips Brewing with an advanced analytics  platform   to help the brewery better understand its business,  specifically as it   relates to private retail liquor store performance  (by SKU) as well  as  the company's market share among regional breweries  and across  British  Columbia's beer industry overall.

Fobi‚Äôs   custom dashboard will enable Phillips Brewing to build  detailed   customer profiles based on various factors, including  demographics,   purchase history, and spending patterns, to better cater  to its   customers' preferences and identify emerging industry trends.  Phillips   Brewing will also gain greater visibility into shoppers' basket    compositions, highlighting the most popular product pairings and other    brands that Phillips Brewing customers frequently interact with or    purchase from. This data can ultimately provide the brewery with key    insights into new opportunities that will drive continued growth and    success, such as future partnerships or collaborations with the most    popular brands within and beyond the craft beer segment.

Wallstreetbetsnew,Sekur Private Data Ltd. Signs Distribution Agreement,"RECENT RELEASE\~ ON STANDY BY FOR NEW PRESS.

&#x200B;

Toronto, Ontario, and New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - August 2, 2023) - Sekur Private Data Ltd. (CSE: SKUR) (OTCQB: SWISF) (FSE: GDT0) (""Sekur"" or the ""Company""), a leading Swiss hosted secure and private communications platform, is pleased to announce that it has signed a distribution agreement for the Kingdom of Morocco, for its Sekur suite of privacy communications solutions, including the upcoming Sekur Enterprise solutions.

The Company has signed a Reseller Agreement with Digital Smart Solution Sarl (""DSS""), a Moroccan IT services consulting company based in Casablanca, Kingdom of Morocco. DSS plans to focus on telecom operators and the banking industry to distribute, in particular, the SekurMessenger solution for enterprises. According to DSS, currently, there is no available reliable private and secure messaging solution in the Moroccan market, and SekurMessenger offers a secure and private solution for SMEs, enterprises and the government sector. DSS will approach the 1st¬†and 3rd¬†third largest Telecom operators in Morocco, as well as several large banking groups and some government organizations, as cyberattacks on mobile phones and Business Email Compromise (""BEC"") attacks have grown exponentially in that in the region. Telecoms targeted have a combined mobile subscriber base of well over 20 million users, with businesses representing over 15% of the subscriber base.

Alain Ghiai, CEO of Sekur Private Data, said: ""We excited to expand into the Kingdom of Morocco as many international companies have their Africa headquarters in Morocco. According to market research, approximately 90% of African businesses are operating without cybersecurity protocols in place, making them vulnerable to cyber threats, such as hacking, phishing, and malware attacks. The economic consequences of digital insecurity are already substantial. This is where Sekur comes in, to ensure private and secure communications and prevent Business Email Compromise (""BEC"") attacks with our SekurSend feature on SekurMail, and to offer a private and secure alternative to data mined messaging applications, with our SekurMessenger and our Chat by Invite unique privacy function. We will also offer our SekurVPN as there is a growing market demand for VPNs. Our prime directive is to provide private and secure communications for everyone, and, as we are not connected to any Big Tech cloud platform, we offer a truly independent, private and secure means of communications without any data mining, through our proprietary technology and our secure servers based in Switzerland. We look forward to offering true data privacy to all Moroccan businesses and government organizations, and protect their intellectual property, and their privacy, from data miners, malicious hackers and rogue agents of foreign powers.""

On April 7th¬†2023, the Company launched its privacy VPN solution called SekurVPN available through¬†[**https://www.sekur.com**](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/3jjBzFGwqX). The Company has seen great success for SekurVPN for consumers, and plans to market to the SMB and enterprise in Q4, targeting the 30 million SMBs in the USA, through several digital and email marketing campaigns.

SekurVPN is meant for privacy enthusiasts and users wanting to mask their IP address and protect their Internet activities from hackers, rogue agents and industrial spies. An example would be users going to their e-banking or shopping online, using their emails, using messaging applications and wanting to have full privacy and protection from hackers hijacking their location and signal. The service guarantees that it does not use Big Tech or Hyperscalers for its functioning or hosting, it guarantees that there are no third party bundles sold with it, so no data is leaked or sold to third parties, it guarantees no traffic pulling or monitoring, and no phone number required to register to the service. Using a private VPN such as SekurVPN can reduce greatly the risk of BEC attacks for C-Level enterprise employees.

Wallstreetbetsnew,$VCIG recap‚Ä¶I‚Äôve seen a lot of pumpers and it‚Äôs made no sense to me.,"$VCIG was the big runner today, and the higher it got, the more pumpers I seen. Literally just longs pumping it with no facts or knowledge being shared behind their ‚Äúpump rant‚Äù SO here‚Äôs the truth: 

VCIG was NOT going to make it over 9 bucks today because there was an invisible barrier at 9 bucks. Back on June 20th, the stock had a big run and consolidated just above 9 bucks, trading 4 million shares in a consolidated range with 9 bucks being the support. After a couple hours it ended up dumping out of that consolidation leaving (let‚Äôs assume 2 million) bag holders.

Today was the FIRST time the stock price every got back to 9 bucks, meaning this was the first time those bag holders have been able to break even in 2 months. So what do you do when you‚Äôre finally able to break even after holding a loser? You SELL AND BREAKEVEN. 

This is exactly what happened today. However, the volume was 30% less today than back in June. Therefore, there simply wasn‚Äôt enough strength for longs to overpower the bag holding longs from June. 

You can see where they had a battle trying to overpower the bag holders and set new highs where the consolidation was today between 8.4 and 9, but it couldn‚Äôt happen and when todays longs finally lost the battle, it cracked under 8.4 and faded and NEW bag holders were created at 8.4. 

If todays volume would‚Äôve been the same or more as it was back in June then it could have very well of soaked up the June bag holders and continued higher, but it wasn‚Äôt and so it didn‚Äôt. 

So when I people pumping this just because of a partnership or AI news in the headline, I just shake my head because 2 month long bag holders do not care, they‚Äôre not rational, they just want out at the first sign of breakeven. So, without the volume to overpower them, it won‚Äôt continue higher.

So while it's common for them to provide free tools, its important to keep the information in context. They're motivated to motivated you to trade as much as possible.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-08-04.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.","['Still want to see last weeks results/recap included.', 'Thank you for your time. üôè', 'thanks for the info and your service!', 'Ok, very new here.\n\nWhen it says ""buy these calls"" in example:\n\nWAL/53/51\t37.94\t$0.65\t$0.77\t0.38\t0.37\t79.0\t1.75\t74.9\n\nDo I buy WAL at 51 or 53....

options,A picture is worth a thousand strikes,"I have attempted to visualize an Options chain.

So much information gets lost in numbers when not presented as a visual.

For instance, apple has on average 15 expiry dates and for each expiry date (for calls and puts) there are at least 20 useful metrics (such as greeks, prices, and implied volatility levels). Hard for humans to digest this information.

In this visual, I have encoded implied volatility as slanted arrows, with the length matching the Implied volatility. I felt static visual is good enough. The animated version is pleasing to the eye but does not add much additional value.

The bid-ask spread and the labeling makes it easier to interpret. Even Encoding volume as an arrow makes it interesting to learn about which strikes are actively traded. With simple annotations such as option price = Stock price - Strike makes it welcoming to options beginners.

What else can we add/ remove?

If you want to, send me your ticker, and I will make a visual for you.

options,Advice Request: Broker Not Honoring Transaction,"The short story:

I bought and sold for a profit 4 SPXW puts on Fidelity on July 19th. Fidelity recognized the sales and immediately removed the contracts from my account. 

When the funds were not added to my account after the settlement period, I inquired further. I went through a tedious process of appealing through the correct channels and received the following letter today, one month after the contract expired.   


> We confirmed that the 4 S&P 500 (SPXW) July 19, 2023, $4550 put contracts that you sold on July 19, 2023, were initially filled as you indicated in your correspondence. Upon review by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) they determined that due to the change in the quote during their look back review, the trades were filled in error and canceled the trades. It is important to note that this decision was made by the exchange, and they have the authority to make these determinations. We regret any frustration this situation may have caused you.  


I'm appalled that the broker would not honor the deal as they completed the transaction, removed the contacts from my account, and never notified me of the cancellation.   


Do you have any resources or advice that can help me understand my rights and options for recourse? ","[""Happens all the time. You have no recourse. Your broker doesn't fill the trade, the exchange does. It's their rules. And if the exchange breaks the trade, the OCC (which clears all options trades) won't clear it. Even Fidelity has no recourse."", 'No recourse likely. You can file a FINRA complaint and see if that yields any results.', ""If they left you in your original account position as if the trade never happened, then you have no ability to argue damage.  If they ate a hunk of your money as it was prior to the trade and don't return that, then yes, that would be theft and you could likely fight it (the crappy PR alone may make them fix things). But unwinding a transaction that couldn't settle isn't you being harmed, it is you missing out on an opportunity. Legally those are different. T+2 is a real thing."", ""That's fucked"", ""So, are you just completely screwed out of all the money you put out to initially purchase those contracts too? I.e. did they screw you out of just the profits, or out of both the profits and the initial capital?\n\nIf it's the former, that sucks but at least you didn't technically lose any money. That would be insane if it were the latter, that would be straight up theft"", ""Please read the CBOE obvious error rule: [https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/release\\_notes/2022/New-Cboe-Options-Obvious-Error-Procedures-Effective-July-1-2022.pdf](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/release_notes/2022/New-Cboe-Options-Obvious-Error-Procedures-Effective-July-1-2022.pdf) \n\nUnfortunately, this isn't Fidelity's fault if the exchange busts a trade. Yes, it has happened to me numerous times in the past."", ""If I understand right, it was the STC that the CBOE says was filled in error, not the BTO. If I understand things right, and I might not, you might be SOL. If it was the BTO order that they're invalidating, I'd think they should be obligated to reimburse how much you paid to buy the contracts."", '""due to the change in the quote during their *look back review*"" this sounds dogy as fuk. what the heck is loop back review? that is if a make a trade, and it is not profitable my loop back review marks it as a stupid trade and cancels it?', ""You might have a case here and I don't think you need a lawyer.  You can for sure file a complaint with FINRA and go through arbitration.  You should be hammering the fact that both the exchange and your broker didn't let you know until after the contracts expired.  You will want to find out when those trades were busted and if they were busted after the option expired, that is inherently unfair as you were unable to place new trades.  If they were busted before, then your broker should have let you know asap so you had a chance to sell them again.  \n\nBig question is if you look at the market price of the option, would you still have been able to sell them at a profit?  If so, you should ask for compensation at what you would have gotten if you sold them at fair market prices at the time that the busted trade happened.  If it's the case that those puts were never profitable at what prices were trading at, then there's no point in pursuing."", 'Trades filled in error should be honored when the trade has been filled and settled by the broker. Otherwise, the broker should have at least informed you that after filling it in error they are cancelling the transaction because there was a change in the quote during the look back review, and returned your premium and called it a day. By not doing so, you have a strong case here against the broker. Good luck!']"

With a tiny account which will limit you to high risk 0DTE trades on low price stocks (read: not strong companies)?  Do you have a plan?  Can you lose your $1200 and be okay with that?

So to be at parity with market return expectations (many traders fail at this) you would need a $10k/0.08 = $125k account. \n\nThe bottom line is you might be able to trade and work your job, but either being busy or being wrong you‚Äôll probably realize plenty of losses along the way.

options,"Expected moves, SPY, QQQ, and Michael Burry's big short.","Stocks are starting off Tuesday in the red. Economic data from China spooked international markets overnight and persistently high treasury yields in the US are starting to take a toll on sentiment. On the positive side, retail sales in the US beat expectations with spending on non-discretionary items, restaurants and more up, but autos and other big-ticket items down. Home Depot reported before the bell and beat estimates but saw a drop year over year in sales, particularly on big-ticket items. Tomorrow we see FOMC minutes. The VIX remains below historical averages at about 16. 

One of the sensational headlines that cropped up yesterday was that Michael Burry of Scion Capital (and the Big Short) bought SPY and QQQ puts that equaled $1.6 billion or essentially 90% of his fund's value. When seeing sensational headlines like that, it's worth checking your spidey senses. The way those reports are filed use the entire multiplier on options as if they were the value of exercising the option (in other words x100). In this case that does not mean he is short $1.9 billion dollars worth of SPY and QQQ, but more likely long about 20k puts (or so) in each. Big, but not $1.9 billion big. In fact, there may even be spreads involved which could make it even less exciting.

However! When seeing headlines like that it's not a bad idea to check in on puts if you had any bearish, or nervous market long feelings. As mentioned, with the VIX still well below historical averages, puts are kinda cheap historically. So here's a look SPY into year-end with current put prices.

With SPY about $445, the expected move out to year-end is about 7%. And skew is high at these low vol levels (meaning out-of-the-money puts are higher IV than at-the-money). Here's a put spread down to the year-end expected move:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vphczn7h5aib1.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf660fc0ead5c98d561cf39a0de502d8d5cddfb

This put spread buys 445 puts and sells 415 puts (both expiring Dec 29th). It costs about $7, with the chance to make up to $23 if the SPY is at or below $415 at year-end. It buys about 13 IV on the 445 puts, and sells about 17 IV on the 415 puts. So it takes advantage of that skew. Its breakeven is about $438, which is not far away at all. A put spread like this is an interesting bearish play, or a hedge for those worried about a market pullback into year-end. It costs about 1.7% of the underlying.

But 7% isn't a disaster, so let's look at at outright put, out of the money, but near the expected move:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/td0fv5lu7aib1.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7fea34502e3a4fdf92818784ce0197a3f3377eb

This 420 put for Dec 29th costs about $8, so more than the put spread to the expected move, but it has unlimited gains below. It would obviously gain in value if the SPY sold off to that strike, but the chances of more than 7% sell-off is obviously less than a move *down* 7%. So it positions more for a large sell-off. The outright put would need the SPY a few dollars below $400 to profit similarly to the put spread at or below $415.

options,Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings Preview,"Stocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.

Of course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.

Since that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6

In other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:

https://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee

That's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.

As far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year. So it's NVDA being NVDA.

options,"Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more.","A couple of giants report after the close, amidst a heavy earnings calendar. On the economic front, we get the NFP jobs number tomorrow morning.

Here's a preview of Amazon and the options setup, which can be a good sense of the overall set-up into an earnings event. The expected move is about 6%. That compares to the most recent earnings moves of -4%, -8%, -7% and +10%. So today's expected move is just shy of the mid of the past 4 earnings moves with the most recent earnings having moved less (-4%). 

The IV of the weeklies is about 100. That compares to the 30 day IV of about 43. Of course, the weekly options expire tomorrow, so really they should be thought of as an expected move, and less so as vega. That 30 day IV (44), which is a purer representation of vega, is higher than the 30 day realized vol (how the stock has actually moved over the past 30 days) of just 27. Amazon's realized vol over the past month is quite quiet compared to how its moved over the past year, with its yearly realized vol being 39. 

That paints a picture of very high IV compared to the stock's very recent history, but options priced for earnings that are leaning towards a move slightly less than the stock has moved over the past year on earnings. This comes in an overall lower IV and realized vol environment over the past few months.

An Iron Condor, set at the expected move, and $1 wide on the wings, would need AMZN to stay within about 120.50 and 136.50. The bullish expected move lines up very near to the highs of 2023 in the stock, which happened within the past month. Here's how that looks on the chart.

&#x200B;

Apple's expected move of 3% compares to earnings moves over the past year of +5%, +3%, +8% and +3%. Again, low IV compared to earnings over the past year, but AAPL's realized vol over the past month is just 13! Options buyers have not been doing well in those conditions and the low IV into earnings is a reflection of that suffering. 3% is about $6 in either direction.

options,SPX 4400 is a key level to watch based on full chain options positioning,"Going into next week SPX 4400 is likely to be a rather important area to watch as it's the largest area of gross gamma and a potential volatility trigger as a result. We remain in negative gamma territory as well, which may add to volatility as dealers are more likely to buy upside and sell downside.

The model is currently showing the potential of $24B of ES buying for every 1% up move and $24B of ES selling for every 1% down move. Gamma flip is currently estimated at SPX 4470.

The delta between SPX and ES is about 10 handles now for those trading futures.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-08-11.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

options,I own PUT options on a stock that was recently delisted. How do I exit the position?,"A few weeks ago I bought 5 PUT contracts with strike 2.50 and expiry 8/18 for Yellow Corp ($YELL /$YELLQ)

The price was trending in the right direction.  Today, something happened and it seems that $YELL was converted to $YELLQ.   Does not seem to be tradable.  I think it was delisted, but correct me if I'm wrong. 

I'm using Ally Invest.   As my options expire in 2 days, I'm wondering if there is any exit strategy here.  If I let the options expire on Friday (ITM) will I be paid out the  difference?   Do I need to exercise the option early? Do I need to contact the broker to handle this?  

Any help is appreciated!


EDIT:    Update -  last week I talked with a rep from Ally on the website chat, they said that what would happen is my options would get exercised on Friday and I should receive in my account $1250  (2.50 strike x 5 contracts) as well as -500 shares (the short shares that I need to ""cover"").   

I would have liked to buy 500 shares of YELLQ outright on Friday to cover the short, but for whatever reason Ally Invest thought the ticker was ""invalid"" and I couldn't trade it directly. 

Anyway I was still able to trade options on this ticker, so in order to guarantee some profit I ended up selling 4 of the 5 PUT contracts for around $1.40 each.   I kept one of them to see what would happen over the weekend. 

In the end the remaining contract was exercised automatically on 8/18.  For this I received -100 shares and $250 as per the strike.  On 8/21 my account shows a transaction to buy 100 shares of YELLQ at $1.57,  which looks like it was initiated automatically  to cover the short. 

Pretty much worked as expected - although in this case YELLQ was still tradable to some degree, so it remains to be seen what would happen with a stock for which it is impossible to cover the short.","['Call your broker', 'delisted? those mfs printin!', 'Like many have said, the OP should definitely call their broker to be safe.\n\nBut could someone with more experience give an idea of what would happen if OP did nothing through expiration?

options,Review Manipulation by Options Trading Course: skyviewtrading.com Be careful before you join them,"Back in Dec  2022, I was in a huge debt after my dad's medical bill which insurance refused to cover.  So I was looking for side hustle. I came across skyviewtrading YT videos and it was quite interesting.  I watch their videos and started watching tastytrade videos. They taught me a lot with their great contents. Few weeks later, I decided to sign up to learn more from skyviewtrading. I signed up for trial. I quickly found that they are telling what tastytrade folks are saying but skyview trading is charging  me. I immediately cancelled my trial.

I later wrote a review on trustpilot  [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skyviewtrading.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skyviewtrading.com)

You know what they did. They somehow managed to have my review removed. There is also another guy had the same issue but he persisted and finally have his review visible (look at 1 star review there).

&#x200B;

Don't trust these skyviewtrading ([https://skyviewtrading.com/](https://skyviewtrading.com/)) folks. A business can have some bad reviews. It is acceptable. But removing bad reviews tell more about business.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Let's make it clear. 1 star review on the trustpilot is not mine. Mine was removed.

&#x200B;","['You have to be very careful with a lot of these ""systems"".\n\nAvoid unrealistic claims. All trading has losses, and particularly with short-term trading. Good traders, depending on the systems they use, vary between 25 to 75 percent failing trades. They usually either have a system of frequent small wins and infrequent bigger losses, or conversely frequent small losses and infrequent bigger wins. If they can\'t own up to the losses, and don\'t have plans for what they do about losses... you\'re hearing b/s.\n\nAvoid vague claims. If you can\'t determine exactly what somebody is going to teach you, how would you decide if the money is worth it? Think about all the job skills for which you can get online education. The full syllabus and approach is provided in advance, you only have to decide if you want to pony up the money for Udemy, Coursera, EdX, etc. It is a transparent transaction, your risk is limited to discovering if they do a good job of teaching what they said they would plus discovering if you\'ll actually do the learning.\n\nAvoid big price tags. I won\'t say I haven\'t ever seen trading systems where the money may have been worth it, but they were in a very small minority. Most of the people pitching systems want so much money up-front that, even if their claims are mostly true, you won\'t break even for a year or two. What is the benefit to you of starting off 1 to 2 years in the hole?\n\nIf somebody will teach you something specific that you *know* is an area of knowledge you lack, and the fees are modest, then sure. It\'s just a typical educational transaction. Look at the fee charged, compare it with what your time is worth to you, and if they are giving you knowledge that saves you a lot of time in digging through mounds of books and weeks of experimenting with paper trading to sift fact from fantasy, then you know the potential value. \n\nAlso, beware outfits that learned their material just a few months before you. There\'s a lot of those out there. I remember watching a Zoom call pitch from one such. He had a pile of books sitting near him for recent reading. Somebody asked about the books. One happened to be a book I had too. If you already have identified the relevant material, buying and skimming a book or two costs you maybe $75-$150 of cash and a few days of your time.

However, it did not pass the Kelly criterion the first time. Therefore, I was faced with the task of optimizing my trading strategy for optimal reinvestment of profits.

Let me say right away that I am well aware that it takes about 16,000 attempts to confirm statistical anomalies, or patterns in a scientific approach, which in my 1DTE case would take about 70 years of testing. So in this post I will rely more on hypotheses I have derived from logic, common sense and my experience. And look for their confirmation on the small sample of data I have.

If you read my previous post carefully, you will remember that I left a window for optimizing the Take-Profit order. Let me say right away that in order to optimize the Take-profit order, I will need to look for a solution within the trading day, and this will require a separate study and possibly a separate post. For now, I have left this aspect without consideration.

But still, in terms of optimizing my game strategy, I only have a 75% hit probability, which in poker terms is even slightly worse than pocket JJs. I should probably consider getting a stronger starting hand before looking for more favorable tables.

And I certainly have the ability to do that.

In the last post, when building my forecasting system, I formulated my own hypothesis of 75% probability as the minimum probability for a well-tuned forecasting system. And also I got this 75% from the assumption that my statistical model gives 100% hits when determining the market direction, but 50% of all days contain unpredictable factors, which are overlaid with an additional layer and with 50% probability will confirm or deny the made statistical forecast.

And as it turned out, I also benefited from the fact that I achieved a continuous forecasting process, namely making a forecast for each trading day.

So if all my assumptions are correct, I will increase the probability of hitting if I exclude in advance those days that contain uncertainty.

Thus, reducing the number of trades will improve my result. All that remains is to learn how to select days with uncertainty in advance.

And here the first thing that comes to mind is that we know in advance the schedule of economic statistics and corporate reporting schedules. This is a good idea, but it will require considerable effort to collect and analyze this data.

Isn't there an easier way?

Since I have collected two validation periods of 120 trading days, and I have a result for each day, I can of course start by analyzing the –°alendar itself.

Let me ask you a question. How do you think my average 75% hit probability will be distributed over the days of the week?Yes in the results of my system the hit probability is not evenly distributed over the days of the week.

I can also calculate the result of my tests for each day of the week. (I calculate the worst case scenario, i.e. the result at the closing price).

Test yourself and answer the question, which days of the week do you think are the best days to trade and which are the worst?

Or in other words, in my case 1DTE QQQ ATM, how will the probability and outcome be distributed depending on the day of the week the prediction is made?

Choices:

1 -from Monday to Tuesday

2- from Tuesday to Wednesday

3- from Wednesday to Thursday

4 ‚Äì from Thursday to Friday

5 ‚Äì from Friday to MondayI can make my assumptions based on the fact that my system is directly dependent on how many players are looking at the monitor and how many are trading.

Again, I will refer to the previous post and remind you of the competition among farmers to determine the weight of a steer by eye. After all, the clerk, who counts the average and always gives the most accurate figure, will not be able to make a prediction if farmers do not come to the competition, and the accuracy of his predictions will increase as the number of participants increases.

And so my guess is that the **worst** cases for my system are:

5 - from Friday to Monday .Few people start important things on Friday

1- from Monday to Tuesday. Monday, the first day after the weekend, should also obviously not be disposed to high activity.

**Best:**

3- from Wednesday to Thursday. Mid-week and big regular economic statistics the next day. If you ask GPT3.5 Chat which day of the week investors are more risk averse, he will give you the. answer that it is Wednesday.

4 - from Thursday to Friday, this variant should lose slightly to variant 3, but not in probability, but in result, because despite the high activity, players want to finish their tasks early before the weekend.

About variant 2 - from Tuesday to Wednesday, I don't have a definite opinion

So the bets are in. Let's see the results of my tests.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qo9tvbw1xhhb1.jpg?width=790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a66bc962837a90fb7c549d2aa912008f4f3a01d

Well, I hope your assumptions match mine. I got my inspiration from observing the weekly activity of a trading desk, which is no different from the work activity of an ordinary office.

Mysterious variant 2 from Tuesday to Wednesday seems to give not bad probability of hitting, but to work with it you need to optimize the parameters of Take-profit order. Leaving a position until the expiration time is obviously a bad idea for this variant.

And what's strange is that my best days in QQQ with its daily expirations coincide very much with the SPY expirations, and Friday of course coincides with the expirations in the weekly contracts in singl stock options. This gives me hope that my trading strategy is scalable.

What's up with my pencil trades?

This time I'm leaving only two trade options per week. From Wednesday to Thursday and from Thursday to Friday.

In a flat scenario.

starting account $10,000

limit per entry 1000 dollars

no refinancing of profits

I get:

And look - in the tests I get even higher absolute result than in my initial variant, when I tried to trade every day. And at the same time, instead of 5 trades per week, I make only 2 trades.

Let's test the system against Kelly's criterion.

starting account 10,000

the bet is equal to 25% of the current account

the limit on a single entry is not restricted.

Result:

Well, this already looks like an ""exponential"".

Obviously, the logic of trading only on active days, even from the position of activity of a regular office, implies that you should not trade in the short and Christmas weeks, and do not forget to go on vacation in time for the vacation season, especially if the market has demonstrated good or even impressive growth results until mid-summer. Or, in other words, I can formulate a rule of thumb - don't rush to trade in an empty market.

At this point, I could thank you all for your attention, and say goodbye. But, uh.

But of course, I left something special for the end.

The picky reader will rightly say that in my period of collecting statistics out of 778 there were only 42 trading days in which the VIX was in the range of 15-12.2, and the days with extremely low volatility were not included at all. And that's where things will bound to fall apart.

And what secrets of the universe did you reveal, if we knew everything perfectly well without you?

Well...

What I'm about to talk about I've known about for a long time, but it wasn't until the research process that I realized how that knowledge could be properly applied.

I realize what an advanced community I write my posts for. And now I will start the most controversial and speculative part of my already controversial and speculative storytelling.

And so, back in the beginning, for my tests I calculated the price of the center for 1DTE QQQ and used the formula for Call or Put as 1.5\*vega\*VIX, or in other words the center price for 1DTE Pc = Const\*VIX. But it is possible to look at this ratio in a different way.

For in this way the mysterious VIX = Pc/const. And the price and price dynamics of any asset can always be represented through the ratio of buyers and sellers. It turns out that the VIX and its dynamics is nothing but a reflection of the actions of the main players in the center, with their interests, plans and strategies.And let it be a parable...***The Parable of the 4 Grand Masters of Option Trading and the Big Bang.***

*Every time the cycle of life in the universe begins with the Big Bang. To understand what moment I am talking about, just look at the chart of any liquid stock or index.*

*Some people manage to see the outline of a Goose on the chart and romantically call this phase of the market ""Black Swan"".*

https://preview.redd.it/w6gxk5ytnhhb1.jpg?width=576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c61c0a08a4bbfcca733bb86f324bab024f5c93c

*But the Big Bang is a little different, after all, and different from the image of the Goose in the graphic.*

*There are a few moments in the market when you stop looking at news and quotes to make a trading decision and stop listening to your analysts. Your stock trading at that moment is based on the rapidly changing figures in your daily report, and you focus on your risk maps and trading limit tables. And you look for a very important chapter in your broker's rules and regulations, using the keywords Margin Call, and Stop Out for a quick search. You make an infinite number of trades per unit of time. And, of course, you fend off incessant calls from clients and top management.*

*The Big Bang process lasts for some time and has some individual characteristics for each participant. But in general, most of your colleagues do roughly the same things during the Big Bang phase.*

*Is it possible to try to earn profit at this moment? Probably you can, but more consistently you get a nervous breakdown instead of profit. In 2008 I had a moment when I had to significantly reduce my hedge (profitable short positions on local index futures). All because the local Exchange was forcibly shutting down a very large player and raised the margin requirements so much that I did not have enough money in my account to fully hold even a right-side up profitable short position. Eventually the big player was unloaded, including on me. At the time of the Big Bang, so many people are concerned with their own survival, sometimes even the trade originators.*

*Should we try to predict the Big Bang? I don't know the exact answer. It would be like answering the question whether one should voluntarily stop one's current habitual life and spend an indefinite period of time waiting for a new one to begin very soon. For me, it is easier to understand the sequence of my actions at the moment of the Big Bang, the main purpose of which is to preserve for myself the opportunity to participate in the new life of the new universe. Moreover, with experience you usually approach the moment of Big Bang with not the most extreme position and usually in liquid assets, which simplifies the task considerably.*

*In any case, the Big Bang phase ends sooner or later, the position is equalized, the leverage level is adjusted, the limits are restored. You start to focus on news and quotes again.*

*Which means a new universe has appeared and life has begun in it.*

*And in the center strike, the 4 Grand Masters of Options Trading come into play.*

*Each of them is very successful, and timely in their participation in the game*

*1- the very experienced and mathematically skilled Master Short Straddle.*

*2- the persistent and optimistic Master Bought Call*

*3- the unsteady but risk-loving Master Bought Put*

*4- coming in late and accumulating profits in the underlying asset Master Covered Call*

https://preview.redd.it/ugjzqdj3ohhb1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f42c1e8941d84d6875375cab53d815e213216b72

*Master Call and Master Put trade only forecasts and market expectations, and always buy options.*

*Master Short Straddle, and Master Covered Call are guided only by their own calculations and statistics and always sell options.*

*The moment of participation in the game of each of the Masters, since the end of the Big Bang phase can be depicted in the form of a schematic time graph.*

https://preview.redd.it/owle0beaohhb1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87203948fda86963c6fc1679df2bb355347c02fc

*After the Big Bang Entropy invariably increases and volatility in the new Universe invariably decreases. And the volatility decrease track starts to be determined by the Great Masters playing in the center.*

*In Phase 1, Master Short Straddle, Master Call and Master Put are playing in the center. This phase has the maximum number of volatility buyers. And its average level is higher than in the other phases of the universe.*

*Eventually Master Put, stops playing, and the universe moves into Phase 2.*

*In Phase 2, only the Master Short Straddle, and Master Call remain in play and obviously the volatility in Phase 2 is lower than in Phase 1.*

*It is only in Phase 3 that the Master Covered Call joins the game. He finally brings volatility (and thus the price of central options Pc) to extremely low values. And the universe comes to an equilibrium.*

Since my system is set up to buy options, it is obvious that my strategy should not be influenced by the games of volatility sellers. After all, they are not trading forecasts. The only point that can influence my system is the boundary between phase 1 and phase 2. Or the very moment at which the Master Put exits the Game.

In other words, if the parable is true, I will be able to find a special value for the VIX.

If the current volatility becomes lower than this special value of VIX, and at this point I start ignoring market down signals, then the result of my strategy will improve.

Or in the limit, (if we abandon the concept of VIX altogether). Starting at some very specific price, I should not buy cheap PUT options, no matter how cheap they are. And that sounds very paradoxical.

If we look for a rational explanation of this paradox, it turns out that the significance of buying a Put, from the perspective of a buyer trading a downside forecast, falls with the price of that PUT. Why buy, even very cheaply, an item you're likely to throw away. And it doesn't matter how cheap the goods are and what discounts there are, because your decision to buy or not to buy is influenced only by your subjective feeling of how quickly and how often you will have to send your purchase to the trash garbage can.

But I'm a little distracted. Let's continue.

To find the VIX parameter, I used 778 trading days from the statistics collection period and my very first chart from the previous post. With the highest possible Vol +- and the worst possible Close result.

Since I prioritize the Vol +- parameter (which determines the maximum possible profit for the option buyer), to find a specific VIX value, it is enough to exclude Vol +- values less than zero using a certain Vix filter and observe the effect on the bottom chart (i.e. on the Close price).

I was able to find out that if you exclude all days with Vol+- <0, with a VIX value <18.1, you can get a better result on the Close price chart with fewer trades.

https://preview.redd.it/4s90vtynohhb1.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7dc53fb2e783c704248f328cb7883bdbf0cf672f

The effect is undoubtedly present, and this is despite the fact that during the period under consideration the average value of VIX was at a fairly high level.

Let's see what this filter will produce on pencil trades.

2 trades per week and VIX filter <18.1

starting account 10 000

bet equal to 25% of the current account

the limit for one trade is not limited.

Result:

https://preview.redd.it/59olprevohhb1.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd96ab88a78156bee0a71cf52beb589359ebb8c5

Well-well - just over $2 million dollars in additional pencil profit with fewer trades.

And all I did was start ignoring risks on a uptrend  ))))

This is where I've stopped my research for now.

And it's time to summarize.

In all seriousness: I have created a statistical model for 1DTE QQQ ATM that makes predictions on just 13 input parameters, of which only 5 are unrelated to QQQ itself. These 5 input parameters are related to the following market segments:

FX

Commodities

Bond market

as well as the S&P500 and VIX.

The model uses 8192 possible variations of combinations of these parameters, 358 of which turned out to be working. The superposition of signals of these 358 unique combinations for each trading day, gives the probability of hitting the direction of tomorrow at an average level of 75% and the forecast is available for each trading day. I optimized my model according to the Kelly criterion by methodically reducing the number of trading signals and trading days. At the first stage I set the most favorable days of the week for entering a trade and it turned out to be Wednesday and Thursday, at the second stage I introduced an additional filter on the VIX index. And excluded all signals directed downward, provided that the current value of VIX at the time of the transaction is less than 18.1.

So far only in test mode, but the system allows you to quickly accelerate your trading account from very small amounts to almost any desired value, due to successive trades and the algorithm of profit refinancing. At the same time, the system is focused only on trading with a 1-day horizon and does not use long-term and medium-term market conditions. This means that the strategy can be started, paused and resumed at any available moment of time.

&#x200B;

*Seriously: I got a working forecasting system and concluded that the market direction is determined by a very small number of experienced and qualified participants 358/8192 (4.3% of all players). Each of them individually cannot consistently predict the market direction. But if enough of them are united into a team, into one big office, their average view on the market will start to bring stable profit. This team is not very disciplined, gaining momentum only by Wednesday, and on Friday they tend to close positions early and stop trading in order to start celebrating the weekend as soon as possible. These people are optimists, and quite soon after the next crisis they start to neglect risks, ignore negative signals and voluntarily refuse to hedge long positions. After all, hedging has never given anyone an additional bonus, but rather vice versa. And to control risks there are risk managers, who were invented for this purpose and are paid money for it.  Each member of the team approaches a crisis from a fairly casual, but not the worst position. But it is in a crisis that they are most active and skillful. The goal of their crisis trading is not to make a profit. In a crisis they try to avoid catostrafic losses, to save their workplace and trading limits. And they try to quickly return to profit at the moment of market stabilization and recovery. Very often they succeed.*

And surprisingly, this description is very similar to the portrait of the trading desks I had the opportunity to work for))

Years go by, technologies develop, but the main secret of the stock market remains the same:

the stock market is not quotes in the newspaper, but first of all people. And it should be taken into account.

Final Conclusion.

If after my story you still have questions about the time-traveling trader from the REUTER article in 1997. My opinion is that it was a clever media campaign on the part of the CME to attract attention, to develop the options market. And in the same way, I was trying to draw attention to myself and my research.

Also in 1997, Kevin B. Connolly published his wonderful book ""Buying and Selling Volatility"" at the end of which was a link to an option calculator in EXCEL. This book started my introduction to the options market, and the calculator was the beginning of my own research and modeling.

As for the strategy from 10k to 300 million, it is not difficult to calculate that if you trade once a week, make 52 trades without a miss for a year, and at the same time take only 62% of profit on the spent option premium (trading days in which it is possible to do it on average more than three days a week).And on the next trade fully reinvest this profit. Theoretically, you can get 300 million in a year by starting your investments with just 1 cent.

It is much more interesting how to put tens and hundreds of millions of dollars into option contracts at the last steps of such a strategy, so that it does not affect the strategy and does not attract much attention? But that's what the profession of a trader is for, isn't it? Or do you seriously think that someone will pay a trader for the time spent on a seven-month research, the purpose of which is to invest only 10,000 dollars with a very vague prospect?)))

At the very end of my story, I will answer a question I asked myself.

What would I like to do in the future?

Although I am not exactly a programmer, I would very much like to participate in the creation of a real AI for the stock market. But open an account for it, put only 25,000 on it once, clearly formulate the rules of trading and say - here, son, practise, and if you don't understand anything, ask me. But let's agree ashore that you pay your own energy bills.

And I'd be very curious to see the results. Maybe the AI will make so much money that it will set up its own foundation or bank and do charity work. Maybe the AI will use the money it earns to explore the secrets of the universe and make Ilon Musk an offer to sell and then definitely take over Twitter (or whatever that thing is called now) that Ilon won't be able to refuse. Or maybe he will come to the unexpected conclusion that the only stable and profitable way to make money on the stock market is to sell trading signals from an experienced AI trader. And the first 10 of them are absolutely free.

I can't know in advance what will happen in the end. But it will definitely not be boring).

options,Implied Volatility in Plain Words,"Hi Guys I'm trying to understand implied volatility. 
As it is one standard Deviation (68% Rule ) from Current Stock Price over year which is adjusted for option expiration date. 

So when i see an option with 20% IV (current stock price = 100 and expiration date 30 days ). Does it means there is 68% Probability during  next 30 days price of stock could be lies between 80 and 120 price range ??? That how iv should interpreted in simple terms? Or am I wrong in interpretation?

Thanks","['**In plain words:** IV is an input into the option pricing model that provides the market price of the option you look at. The whole idea that IV can be turned into a symmetric range is flawed for several reasons.\n\n**In more detail:**\n\nYou can find a decent, non-technical explanations of IV [here](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/76367/54838). In a nutshell, since every moneyness level (strike) has a different IV, although you have only one underlying, you cannot back out the range, as it would be different for every option you look at. There are two simple explanations:\n\n1 ) Empirically, IV tends to overestimate RV, commonly referred to as [Volatility Risk Premium](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-the-volatility-risk-premium-634dba2160ad)\n\n2 ) IV is the only free parameter in the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model. Higher IV can be a result of compensation for tail risk. \n\nThe second point is best explained by quoting from [Just What You Need To Know About Variance Swaps - JP Morgan Equity Derivatives](https://www.sk3w.co/documents/volatility_trading.pdf)\n\n> For each strike and maturity there is a different implied volatility\n> which can be interpreted as the market‚Äôs expectation of future\n> volatility between today and the maturity date in the scenario implied\n> by the strike. For instance, out-of-the money puts are natural hedges\n> against a market dislocation (such as caused by the 9/11 attacks on\n> the World Trade Center) which entail a spike in volatility; the\n> implied volatility of out-of-the money puts is thus higher than\n> in-the-money puts.\n\nAs mentioned in a comment, a straddle does not represent a 1SD move as suggested elsewhere because the price of a straddle is equal to the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the stock price. You can see an explanation [here](https://money.stackexchange.com/a/155064/109107). \n\n[Breeden Litzenberger](http://efinance.org.cn/cn/fe/Prices%20of%20State-Contingent%20Claims%20Implicit%20in%20Option%20Prices.pdf) (B&L) showed how you can get the conditional risk-neutral density of the underlying using the second derivative of the option price with respect to the strike. Essentially, traditional Arrow-Debreu prices pay 1 dollar in one particular state of nature, so B&L rescale that butterfly strategy. The link I gave above where IV is explained shows the resulting probability density function alongside a vol surface in a GIF. \n\nLast but not least, even this is just a risk neutral expectation that is more likely than not different from a real-world expectation. However, that is all you can get from option prices.', ""No that's not correct as it isn't adjusting for DTE. A more extreme example of that logic, SPY options expiring today have 24% IV. Obviously a 68% chance that SPY is within +/- 24% move today (e.g. 32% chance it moves more than that) isn't true. Here are a few tidbits that might help you understand better.\n\nIV is quoted in annual IV as you noted. Generally this is taken as 252 trading days in a year. You can take IV of any option (DTE doesn't matter here) and convert it to daily IV by dividing by the square root of 252. E.g. you 20% IV options you mentioned would imply approx. 20%/SQRT(252)=1.26% daily moves (up or down).\n\nIf you want to see what the one standard deviation move options are implying at a given expiration date, that amount is the ATM straddle price. So your 20% IV 30DTE 100 Strike example would have a straddle price of about $4.60, implies 68% chance stock price is between 95.40 and 104.60 at expiration.\n\nFor a 2 SD move, double the straddle price- e.g. 95% chance stock is between 90.80 and 109.20 at expiration."", 'An old market maker once told me that the IV of a given contract is, essentially, whatever value is needed in a given pricing model to make that model spit out the actual price.  We know extrinsic value, we have a good understanding of what time value should be, so what‚Äôs left is the amount the market is willing to pay for that contract outside of that.  It‚Äôs a bit more complex than that but if you want a pratical answer this isn‚Äôt a bad one.  It‚Äôs a bit like the P/E multiple on a stock.  It‚Äôs not objective, rather it reflects the market‚Äôs opinion on that product at that point in time.  In the options world it usually reflects the expected speed of movement which is important in options due to the time limitation of the contracts as opposed to shares.\n\nAgain, people can debate this stuff based on the textbooks, but as a practical matter, I like this one.  It‚Äôs like using delta as a probability.  It‚Äôs not exactly true but it works practically good enough.', 'Here‚Äôs my ELI5 version ü§ì\n\nIV is kind of a misnomer?

options,Exploring low-risk options strategies,"I've got $12k in cash and a goal to earn around $60 per trading day. I'm curious to know if there are any options strategies out there that could help me achieve this target. I'm already familiar with covered calls and selling puts, but they haven't quite met my expected returns. I'm wondering if there are other strategies I might be overlooking.

I'd greatly appreciate hearing from those who have experience in this area. If you've found a strategy that aligns with my goal and offers lower risk, I'd love to learn from your insights.

Thank you in advance!","['When you annualize that expectation it is over a 100% return uncompounded.

That is going to require some level of risk.\n\nIf you put that 12k in a money market (pretty much no risk), that is going to give you $600.   \nIf you put that in an S&P 500 Index fund, assuming an average return of 10%, that will give you:  1200.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOption and futures are leverage derivatives, so by their nature, low risk isn't really their thing.

options,Do market makers hedge their positions against spx?,I read another article on here talking about which market data I need to purchase to trade spx and came across that strategy by market makers. Is this true? I know enough about mm's but thats on the forex side of money,"['From my limited understanding yes, let‚Äôs say you buy a call, a market maker will delta hedge that call with the underlying.', 'options, futures, and stock could be used', ""Hold periods are usually very short for market makers (like under 5 seconds) and those strategies usually trade A LOT (this the name high frequency trading), so it doesn't really make sense to hedge on a individual trade basis like you might delta hedge on an OTC option or something.  They typically hedge on the aggregate book of exposure. So if they're long $10,000,000 of exposure and short $12,000,000, even if that's across hundreds of thousands of transactions, they would look to buy ~$2,000,000 of delta exposure (they'll sometimes use options, thus the delta, but if its easier to think of it as buying $2M of the stock, its the same thing)\n\nAt my hedge fund we were very rarely exactly hedged. You usually had some tolerance, and once your exposure got outside that tolerance, you would hedge back to zero."", ""Yes.  Market makers have certain legal obligations.  They're required to provide liquidity and just about everything they do is delta neutral high frequency trading, like [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage).  So if you buy from them and they sell to you, then they're buying something else as well to balance.  It's like a 3 way trade.\n\nFor providing this service market makers have a significantly discounted trading fee from the exchange.  This way they can make a penny off of a trade and actually make that penny instead of it being eaten up in trading fees.  Without the reduced trading fees they wouldn't be able to provide the liquidity that they do."", 'To be a market maker means that you have to take both sides of a trade,that‚Äôs all a market maker does is hedge.Keep delta as close to 0 as possible and profit off the bid ask spread', 'If you are buying, that means they‚Äôre selling, so yep. Could be an option, could be a swap, could be futures. But if you‚Äôre buying from a broker/dealer, yep.', 'For an ATM CALL:\n\nIf the MM buys 1 Call ,he will short 50 shares.\nIf the MM sells 1 Call, he will buy 100 shares.\n\nJust the standard process then it can be very complicated.', 'No, depends on the strategy.  I‚Äôve never seen a hedge strategy with SP solely.  An offset is likely.', "" Market makers play a crucial role in financial markets, especially when it comes to trading SPX options. One of their key strategies involves hedging to manage risks effectively.\r  \n\r  \n**Here's how it works:** When market makers receive orders from traders to buy or sell SPX options, they take the opposite side of the trade to provide liquidity. This means they become exposed to potential losses if the market moves against their positions.\r  \n\r  \nTo mitigate these risks, market makers use hedging strategies. For example, if they sell SPX call options, they may simultaneously buy other call options or underlying assets that move similarly to SPX. This way, if the market rallies and their short call options lose value, the purchased options or underlying assets can offset those losses.\r  \n\r  \n**Let's take an example**: Suppose a market maker sells SPX call options at a specific strike price to a trader. To hedge this position, they might buy call options on individual stocks or an ETF that tracks the SPX. If the SPX rises, the short call options may incur losses, but the purchased call options will gain value, thus balancing out the risk.\r  \n\r  \nSimilarly, if market makers buy SPX put options from a trader, they might hedge by shorting individual stocks or using put options on other assets. If the SPX drops, the purchased put options or short positions will offset potential losses from their long put options.\r  \n\r  \nThese hedging strategies help market makers remain profitable and provide liquidity to traders without taking excessive risks. However, it's essential to remember that market conditions can change rapidly, and market makers continuously adjust their hedges based on real-time data and market movements.\r  \n\r  \nUnderstanding how market makers hedge their positions can provide valuable insights for traders. It highlights the complexity of financial markets and the importance of liquidity providers in maintaining stability. Keep exploring and learning, and use this knowledge to enhance your trading strategies!"", ""Google the Gamma Trade.  You use gamma to tell you when its going to be more profitable to be into stock or derivatives.  Gamma tells you which to buy and sell. Then you buy/sell stock to fine tune your delta back to zero. This allows a fund or an MM to hedge their portfolio at all times while still profiting off of appreciation of the stock. They use similar strategies for hedging volitility and interest rates.  \n\nThe funds and the MMs don't care whether the market goes up or down.  They don't care whether you, the investor, is buying or selling. They are 100% hedged and are just using your trades to move their positions in and out of the market.""]"

Learn options and a broker platform to know how to make and manage trades, then develop a plan based on your goals, trading style, strategies you learn, account size, and risk tolerance.

Here's a brief rundown of how this works.\r  \n\r  \nFirst off, you might want to consider Managed Accounts. These are investment accounts where a professional money manager trades on your behalf. The manager has discretionary authority over the account, which means they can make buy and sell decisions without needing to consult you first.

This is a more modern approach facilitated by several online trading platforms. In this setup, you choose a trader whose trading strategy you like and then replicate their trades in your account.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-08-25.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

options,Are options favored to the seller?,Are options stacked against the buyer by design? Similar to sports betting where the loser often pays 100% and the winner makes 90% with 10% to the house. Is the spread the mathematical equivalent of the house keeping money?,"['>Are options stacked against the buyer by design?   \n\nIn theory you could say that, but theory and reality are often very different. Anyone can find studies that back up the ""options sellers have the advantage"" claim, but a big rule of the markets is ""Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results"". Anything can happen at any time. I\'ve seen a lot of options sellers (including myself) lose 6+ months of gains on a short put trade. When you consider that as a possibility, the ""higher probability of profit"" advantage for sellers kinda goes out the window, IMO.  \n\nOption selling is basically the risk management business, just like an insurance company. You collect premiums here and there, but you\'d better pray that a Hurricane Katrina doesn\'t show up. And if one does, you better know how to manage the risk or you\'ll be wiped out.  \n\nObviously you can do spreads to define your risk, but I\'m personally not a fan of them. However some people seem to love them, so to each their own', '>Are options stacked against the buyer by design?\n\nNo. Sellers have a greater chance of winning than losing which is probably why many people think sellers have an advantage. But when a seller loses, the magnitude of the loss can be and often is far greater than the potential gain was.\n\nIt is the opposite for the buyer. They have a smaller chance at winning but if they win, the magnitude of the gain can be and often is greater than the potential loss was. \n\nThis makes profits with selling a lot more consistent than with buying. If you buy options with half of your account and do YOLO plays like many WSB people then you never give yourself enough chances to see that consistency because the chance to win is much lower.\n\nLike other people here said, if selling always had an advantage then hardly anyone would be buying. If the premiums seem low then people will buy and if they seem high then people will sell. And it gets to an equilibrium point that seems fair to the buyers and the sellers, just like with stock prices.\n\nWhat determines the ""advantage"" after the fact is implied vs historical volatility. If historical volatility was lower than implied, then sellers had an advantage by receiving greater premium relative to the risk they took. And vice versa for buyers', '> Are options stacked against the buyer by design? \n\nI want to say no to this. The other replies make good points, but I think no is closer to being correct than yes. The real problem is that the question is framed incorrectly. The premise is wrong.\n\nUnlike a casino, arbitrage forces all sides of a trade to be efficient. That means it\'s impossible for one side of a trade to have a built-in advantage over the other, forever and for all. If there was such a built-in advantage, you\'d be able to make risk-free trades against that advantage.\n\nAnd who would be a buyer if the game is always rigged to the seller\'s advantage?\n\nThe reality is that it\'s complicated. There are many trade-offs involved, and if you pick one set of trade-offs, sellers have an advantage. If you pick a different set of trade-offs, buyers have an advantage. So it\'s really more a matter of perspective and what you prioritize in terms of risk/reward.\n\n> Is the spread the mathematical equivalent of the house keeping money?\n\nIronically, yes, but not in the way you think. In this case, the ""house"" is market makers. They are for-profit businesses, and they build their profit margin into the bid/ask spread of every contract they create liquidity for.\n\nBut unlike what you are thinking, this does not necessarily mean that trading the bid/ask is negative expected value. That\'s how the house of a casino makes money. Let\'s say there is a trade that makes $100 (gross) for you on average (regardless of how much capital you put at risk). If the MM skims $3 off of every $100, so that you pocket $97 in profit, that doesn\'t mean the trade is a losing proposition. On the other hand, at the casino, you put $100 down on a gambling table and on average, you only get $97 back, so that the house keeps $3. That\'s negative expected value.\n\nWe should not be angry about MMs marking up the price of contracts so that they make a profit. It\'s exactly the same for anything we buy as consumers. A wholesaler marks up a price of some produce and then a retailer marks up the wholesale price, so that everyone gets a share of profit. This is true for lots of products you buy.', 'The way the option works and ends is favored to the seller which is what I love about it. If you sell a put for a agreed apon strike if the stock doesn\'t drop to the price in the time frame you keep all the premium. Also during the life of the option theta is working it over lowering the price were by expiration date it is a fraction. \n\nEven if the stock moves against you to a degree you are still safe and you also can control what you agree to. You go in knowing what you will get in premium and what price you will buy the shares for. The only downside is if the stock drops further than expected but that is with any stocks. Even then you can sell covered calls on the new stock you have pulling in further premiums. I have held stock positions that were negative that still was bringing in in come for me and producing. The ""negative"" was a paper loss and was ignored. After a time the stock came back up. Some times even assigning my call option. \n\nSome times I would have to roll my option out and to a higher strike to secure more capital gains because the stock price had gone up a good bit. Each time I rolled I got more and more credits and was rising the strike on the stock. All was profitable although somewhat limited on the profit from the stock. That said those sudden movements are just part of the game. My aim is to get consistent income and turn my money. Not sit on a stock that is going side ways or down with no benefit to me.\n\nI usually aim for 1% a week or greater with a itm rating of 25-35%. High iv is a blessing.', 'The statistical return of an option to a buyer is 0. The statistical return to a seller is a 0. This is theoretical and proven in reality as well. Options are beneficial as a hedge because it is lower cost opposition protection. If you are a bull it is a leveraged bear position. So your real assets can dominate your portfolio and the option can protect declines. Now when you are trading on short term statistics get funky. The market is almost so random on the 1-2 month time frame you are essentially donating your money', ""Yes, to a degree.  While the math works out like that of a casino, it's not by design in the same way.  Option buyers buy options as a kind of hedge.  Because some can profit from gambling is a secondary benefit or detriment depending upon your point of view."", 'Sellers have an edge. Not sure why people are saying the buyer has an edge. Sellers benefit from theta and buyers do not. Also the majority of options expire worthless. Some might argue that‚Äôs accounted for in the options gain/ loss in that the 70% of the time the seller wins is offset evenly with the 30% of the time they lose. But in reality that‚Äôs often like comparing a paper loss with a real loss. The seller can still be profitable if they lose a buyer can not.', 'Options have extrinsic value and intrinsic value when in the money. As buyer you pay ‚Äûextra‚Äú the extrinsic value in hope that the intrinsic value increases, but you lose the extrinsic value over time (time decay) and in some cases because of volatility', 'Theta gang enters the chat', 'The problem with buying premium is that you are dependent on the directional movement of the underlying in whatever time you have left before expiration, whereas with selling premium you just need the stock to stay within a range.']"
options,SPY vs. SPX returns are vastly different,"I noticed that SPY returns for the same delta options as SPX have returned a much larger amount in most cases.

[Gap fill data SPY YTD 2023](https://preview.redd.it/457dtc3a9vhb1.png?width=2653&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e44cfffa3475b15c81ef25c9e5fc3bd1158156)

a gap up is when the closing price of day 1 is lower than the opening price of day 2.example:Monday‚Äôs closing price: $100Tuesday‚Äôs opening price: $105

a gap down is when the closing price of day 1 is higher than the opening price of day 2.  
example:Monday‚Äôs closing price: $100Tuesday‚Äôs opening price: $95

a gap fill is when day 2's price touches day 1's closing price.

breakdown/takeaway:so far this year, when SPY gaps down, that gap fills 76% of the time. this means 76% of the time, price will increase to the previous day‚Äôs closing price. taking an upside bias on gap down days seems to be working very well, at least targeting the gap fill.","[""Believe it or not, most of these technical analysis have a very high probability, like the ascending triangle has 78 percent probability that it will breakout resistance.

Futures are lower this morning following bank downgrades. On the economic front, we saw some FOMC speeches. Philly Fed President Harker suggested the Fed is done with rate hikes. 1,2, and 10 yr US treasury yields are all lower this morning. The VIX is back towards 17 this morning, continuing a recent wake-up in option vol from the mid-summer doldrums. 17 is still below the historical mean but option prices aren't as dirt cheap as they were just a few weeks ago. 0DTE SPY IV for today closed at just 7 yesterday, pricing in less than an 0.5% move, futures are already lower by more than that pre-market so expected an increase in that IV on the open. SPY vol for Thursday and Friday closed yesterday at 11, still low but showing an upward curve. 30-day IV in SPY (at the money) was closer to 14.

options,Buy a straddle. Sell a strangle.,"I‚Äôm curious if anyone has used this strategy and has had any success or has any advice.

The idea is essentially to buy a straddle on something with daily expirations, say something like 90DTE. Then sell a short dated strangle, something like 3DTE. Then roll the sold legs and adjust with the movement of the underlying.

Once a direction is established probably cut the losing side and ride the leftover diagonal on the winning side.

This obviously requires a lot of management but I‚Äôm curious about everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this.","[""Yes it's called a double diagonal. I trade them a lot but imo it only makes sense as a structure if you are trying to capture IV inefficiencies between expirations.

And if they're the essential part of the position, they could also be treated as a separate trade altogether -- instead of opening a double diagonal, you might do nothing, wait for direction to be established, and then open a single diagonal."", 'You‚Äôd be long Vega and short gamma with this type of position, so if price starts to move a lot more than what‚Äôs implied you‚Äôll lose money', 'Your long side is unlikely to provide a hedge for the short side running away from initial spot price.\nPaper trade it to see.', 'Just make sure to leg in', 'Did you just invent the butterfly?', ""How do you lock in capital inefficiencies between expirations? \n\nWhat I don't understand about these calendar strategies is that the long leg will always be more expensive (in dollar terms because of the additional time premium) than the short leg, so you will need to sell multiple legs to profit. How do you guarantee that the volatility inefficiency will still be there after the first short leg expires?"", ""I've been playing with one on TLT because I don't see a lot of movement coming up with inflation easing and the Fed near peak rates. The strat has been, short legs 45 days out, longs about a year out. Position was opened at net $0 cost.  Each month, roll the shorts and use the premium to roll the longs in to tighter strikes, with the goal being to eventually convert the whole spread to a double calendar basically for free. Not sure whether it's worth doing all of that, rather than just rolling straight out, since I haven't made it to calendar yet. But I think I have a few more months of low movement to work with."", 'Yes the you are right. Without specifying the adjustments it is really open ended because a lot can be done. That is part of the reason it appeals to me - because there would be so many options in managing the position.\n\nI was thinking about selling a pretty wide straddle though and rolling it daily with the movement of the underlying. Essentially just enough to offset theta loss on the straddle.']"
options,"Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto","Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.

Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.

A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:

- moves like the stock / breakeven price much lower
- requires less capital up front

Or is it only used as an indicator of what people want (I am not interested in gambling 0dte and weeklies which is quite popular) ?

options,KOLD Ratio Spread Update: Betting Against Gas Price Surges & The Weekend Weather Effect,"The EIA has announced that last week's natural gas inventories in the Lower 48 states saw an uptick of just 18 billion cubic feet. This morning though, I already had an inkling that the gas futures might experience a slight rebound, and so given the fact that I aimed to offload OTM Calls on KOLD at a premium, I opted against waiting on the EIA data release.

[Turns out, my intuition was spot on](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/15kxqwb/monday_gas_deja_vu/). Today, I acquired 10 of the 09/15 $65 Calls and liquidated 25 of the 09/15 $73 Calls, bagging a credit of $455 in the process.

Considering the position I initiated on August 7th, I'm now holding 55 short contracts at a $73 strike, complemented by 10 long contracts at strikes of $60 and $65, respectively. This brings my total credit to $887.

I habitually earmark a reserve for such trades. For this venture, I've designated $30k. Initially, I tapped into just under half of this sum. However, today seemed an opportune moment to leverage the full amount.

I don't see any serious potential for natural gas prices to plummet in the three weeks leading up to expiration. Yet even if something unexpected transpires and KOLD ascends, necessitating more collateral on my part, I still retain the flexibility to seal the position, securing some extra premium along the way.

You just describe what you did and what you have done. Do you have any questions or want feedback ?', '1. Why not sell naked calls at a higher strike?  Do the long calls closer to the money help your break-even if wrong and gas prices lower?\n2. If gas prices do go down, is your exit typically to sell the long calls for profit and keep the naked calls expecting a mean reversion?\n3. What DTE is your sweet spot to open new call ratios?', ""Thanks for the insightful questions.  \n1. I lean towards initiating almost delta-neutral positions. If I misjudge, naked call selling can quickly lead to two primary issues ‚Äì potential losses upon closing and escalating risks. This leaves me with a few choices: either lock in losses (wholly or partially), attempt to roll my sales to a loftier strike (increasing volume or extending the expiration), or just cross my fingers for a market about-face. Making such decisions can stir emotions and sometimes skew my judgment regarding my stance and the broader market dynamics. That's been my experience. With a ratio spread, significant errors in gauging price levels and timing would be necessary for a similar predicament. A minor dip in gas prices won't trigger it, since both legs (sold and purchased) would appreciate. This grants me more flexibility in my response and lessens anxiety.  \n2. If my prediction holds and gas prices persistently slide, I might either clinch the position at a gain or shift it to the subsequent month. Presently, my call ratio for September contracts stands at 1:3 with strikes at $60 ‚Äì $73. I'd wind that up while concurrently launching a 1:3 call ratio with strikes at $65 ‚Äì $83 for October. This transition would yield a premium. In essence, I'd secure a portion of my gains and sustain a more guarded stance (thanks to a broader spread) in the October contracts. With KOLD's decay over time and the already low gas prices, hitting $83 is a long shot. The purchased leg, which effectively cost me nothing (given the premiums I've amassed surpass the outlay), then acts as a no-risk lottery ticket. To circle back, I'd typically ensure my sold leg isn't left bare. Exceptions might arise if I'm wary of commissions, but those are rare instances.  \n3. For fresh call or put ratios, my sweet spot lies between one to two months for expirations. Short-term contracts introduce a degree of unpredictability, demanding either tight strikes or a high ratio. This approach is akin to selling naked calls or puts, where mistiming can breed complications, as mentioned in point 1. Expirations too far out often suffer from liquidity issues, and the loss from execution can mount. When gauging the return on capital employed, it's frequently less lucrative and tends to be less dynamic, offering fewer windows of opportunity. Hence, a 1-2 month range is my go-to.""]"
options,This helped me have a more intuitive understanding of rho,"I know this is likely obvious to the options connoisseurs in this sub, but rho got clearer to me after simulating a trade idea using LEAP synthetic shares on margin secured by owning the bonds I would need to buy the shares at expiry if necessary. I‚Äôd be earning interest on the bonds, while holding 100 long delta on SPY.

So this strategy is of course anticipated by the market, which forces me to set strikes higher than the current price to keep a net 0 cost, by approximately the same % as the risk free rate for the same term bonds as the expiry, or alternatively, pay approximately the risk free rate in debit to open strikes at the current price.

So, if I‚Äôd set up the LEAPs before rates rose, I‚Äôd have profited from increased rho as I would have locked in a lower rate on my synthetic shares. Conversely, if I had high conviction rates were going back down (which I do not), I could set up a synthetic short, buy the shares now to cover in the future, and take a credit at the risk free rate for the duration of the synthetic position.
 
Same logic applies to box spreads, where I can borrow or lend at the risk free rate through options, and the change in rates over the term may make my loan gain or lose value. 

Rho is just the market‚Äôs way of adjusting option prices for the time value of money at a changing prevailing risk free rate.

Again, probably not news for most of you, but a lightbulb moment for me.","['> Rho is just the market‚Äôs way of adjusting option prices for the time value of money at a changing prevailing risk free rate.\n>\n> Again, probably not news for most of you, but a lightbulb moment for me.\n\nI bet it\'s news to a lot more people than either of us might guess. Congrats on the lightbulb turning on and for sharing.\n\nMy sort of ""story telling"" narrative way of thinking about rho is that the risk-free rate is your performance benchmark. If taking no risk yields 5%, taking some risk of loss better pay more, or you are doing something wrong. So if a call starts out adding a risk premium of 0.5% over the risk-free rate, but interest rates jump up to 6% (i.e., +1% over the rate that the call was opened at), something about the contract has to change to reflect that the risk you are taking needs to be compensated above the new risk-free rate. Because your risk didn\'t go away just because interest rates went up.', 'Very good. Looking for arbitrage possibilities is one of the best way to understand options.', 'This sounds 100% like a natural way to understand this part of pricing.  The thing I would add is that you get the pricing closer to riskless rate if you sell off the additional big risks/benefits the LEAPS contract gets you: limited liability (""the right but not the obligation to buy at call strike X"") and repricing of volatility (ie, long volatility/Vega exposure).  (Ignoring dividends here.)  You can do that by selling the put at the same strike as the call you\'d buy.  That will make the net extrinsic price more comparable to ""risk free"".\n\nBut it\'s the same concept: you can put in a portion of the total capital today (ie, strike price times multiplier) to get the exposure and pay extra extrinsic to not need so much capital today (ie, a financing charge for the option\'s term).  So if time value/rates go up, the extra you\'d need to pay will naturally be higher (ie, long call options are positive rho)', 'Which is also a good bar for stock expectations ‚Äî saw an interesting post on how long duration treasury rates rising (and prices falling) while stocks rally implies improved earnings expectations for stocks (or falling market risk premium), for exactly the reasons you‚Äôve stated.

Trading SPX does not have early assigment as it is cash settlement only.

Will the trade  be zero or I have to pay back some cash I received when I opened the trade?

I am a bit confused about the expiration day.

One other question is about the time of expiration of the trade. The example below is 319DTE but I did with 30DTE and the result is the same.

I understood the trade but I tried to find an answer about that.

Trade Simulation on TastyTrade:

SPX Jun/2024 - 319 DTE

call 4500/4600

put 4500/4600

credit: US$ 9520

\-7.12 broker fees

Total = 9512.88

Margin BP reduced by US$ 487.12

Which means I will have a credit of 9512.88 and my margin will be affect by 487.12

options,Pivoting from selling to buying,"I'm mainly a net seller and have been active for about 3.5 - 4 years, on a decent month I make anywhere between 4%-7% RoC. Simply stuck to selling cuz it required relatively less monitoring (compared to buying), offered more flexibility in terms of adjustment and obviously higher PoP. But as I start observing the price action more closely and on a full time basis, I notice that scalping and taking swing trades with a holding period of max 35% of DTE could give decent returns of 30% - 50%. However, I understand that a hit rate of 4+ out of 10 trades as a buyer is pretty good.

I am trying to pivot to net buying strategies and intra-day scalping with very little capital to test the waters. For those who have pivoted from a premium collector to premium payer:

1. Did you find it more stressful ?
2. Is there any position management you do ? (I can think of selling further OTM strikes to lock-in some gains post a large favourable directional move)
3. Do you keep stop-loss or let your trades breathe ?
4. Max holding period as a % of DTE ? I understand holding options for the first 25% - 30% of DTE won't hurt a lot in terms of theta decay
5. Do you avoid buying in high VIX environments ? and prefer buying during moderate or low VIX periods ?

My objective is split my trading to 70% selling & 30% buying gradually and bump up my monthly run-rate into the 8%-15% range (during a decent month). I don't think I would explore this side of trading if I hadn't been in trouble as a net seller.

options,"""SPX options are priced based on ES""...So does this mean I ignore the SPX chart?","""SPX options are priced based on ES"" is something I read recently.  So does this mean I just ignore the SPX chart and choose my strikes based on ES?

Because their chart prices differ so its confusing to sell options in one underlying with slightly different prices but base everything on another underlying who's chart has slightly different prices.

Example.  

Today at 1015-1030 the market did a little double top.  On the SPX chart it was at 4476, but on the ES chart it was at 4493ish

If I was basing my trade on the SPX chart I'd sell a SPX call at the 4480 strike...if I was basing my trade on the ES chart I'd sell a SPX call at the 4495 strike. 

Whats the correct idea?  I must be misunderstanding....the SPX options may be ""priced"" based on ES but they are ""settled"" based on the SPX price since they're SPX options after all no?

This whole ""SPX options are priced based on ES"" got my brain a little twisted.  Forgive the newb question...I appreciate the clarification.","['>""SPX options are priced based on ES""...So does this mean I ignore the SPX chart?\n\nThat is inaccurate. SPX options are priced on the SPX.\n\nES is priced on the future value of SPX at contract expiration (essentially it just accounts for interest rates and dividends from now until contract expiration, which is why the prices are slightly different). As the ES contracts come closer to their expiration, they will eventually converge to the SPX price.\n\nThe whole theory that ""ES prices drive SPX prices"" is essentially based on trading volume and arbitrage. There are billions of dollars in notional traded in ES contracts every day, much more than the combined volume of the underlying stocks that make up the S&P 500. Since the SPX and ES have an arbitrage relationship, there are many market participants who trade the underlying stocks to take advantage of any mispricings until they disappear. In this way, the volume in ES contracts drive price changes in the SPX more than the underlying stocks (most times).\n\nHope this helps!', 'Settlement is determined by the closing price you see on the SPX and not the ES so base decisions on the SPX chart.  (some SPX options actually settle on the opening price so beware.  These are the monthlies and should be marked as AM contracts)\n\nWhat they may have meant is that you might see prices move a bit sooner on the ES than SPX like when news breaks.', 'SPX Prices aren‚Äôt based on ES. SPX is the real time value of the S&P500. ES is a futures contract based on the future value of the S&P500. SPX is the actual price of the index, and ES is a price that tracks the index presuming rational behavior. Their prices will slightly diverge at times, as will the price of SPY and SPX/ES. But in the long run, they should be so similar that many people consider them indistinguishable.\n\nEdit to clarify ‚Äî the performance of SPX and ES will diverge, the prices are usually distinct as ES represents the future value of the S&P500. The prices converge as the ES contract expires. \n\nTheir performance will diverge because the buying and selling an ES contract is not coordinated with the buying and selling of the components of the S&P500. So someone crossing the bid/ask spread to buy ES can happen simultaneously with someone else crossing the bid/ask spread to sell enough components of the S&P500 that results a price difference.', 'SPX charts are only available during regular hours, while SPX options and ES are traded in pre and after market', 'Market Makers will price the SPX options off the ES future.

As the current/es future moves towards expiration, the difference will come down towards zero.  When I‚Äôm trading spx options, sometimes I just go off of the delta of the spx options.  If I want to make sure I‚Äôm on a certain side of support or resistance, I apply the current offset to the /es value to get where I want to be in the spx options.  I only trade options with a few days to expiration, so the offset doesn‚Äôt change enough to matter to me while any one trade is open.

options,Early assignment of the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread. Looking for advice.,"Hi everyone,

I've just got an assignment notification from my brokerage that the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread (**AAPL Sep01'23 185 Put)** has been assigned. It is a long position with a quantity of 300 AAPL shares at an average price of $185. 

I currently am unable to hold the shares as my account isn't big enough to do so.

What should I do? I read that I should create a Covered Stock Option and sell my 300 shares and close my long leg (**AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put)** and get back some extrinsic value.

On the other hand, as AAPL's last traded price is at $174.70, should I just exercise my long leg (AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put) and cancel out my long position of 300 shares? What is the benefit of doing so and is it worth considering?

I am new to options trading and I'm surprised that early assignment has happened so quickly to me.

options,IV strategy,"We've observed that the implied volatility (IV) across various maturities begins to ramp up roughly 30 days leading up to earnings, peaking the day prior. This is followed by the well-documented phenomenon of IV Crush post-earnings.

To capitalize on this rising volatility typically seen ahead of earnings announcements, I'm contemplating a strategy involving a calendar spread coupled with a straddle, both of which stand to gain from the uptick in IV.

Given that time decay, or theta, intensifies in the option's last 30 days to expiration, the strategy I propose entails initiating the position 30 days before the earnings release. This allows us to capture the entirety of the volatility surge. The chosen expiration for the options would be 60 days out, ensuring that just as the IV is peaking and just before the IV Crush, the impact of theta on the option premiums is minor. This helps in preserving the maximum intrinsic value of the options. We aim for the surge in IV to be the primary driver that enables us to exit the position right before the onset of IV Crush.

Trade Example:

XYZ stock, with an earnings announcement due in 30 days.

Today's date: August 15, 2023

Calendar put spread: Long September 15 put + Short October 15 put

Straddle expiration: October 15

Position to be liquidated one or two days prior to the anticipated IV Crush.

I'm in the process of backtesting this strategy. Any insights or feedback on this approach?","[""Assuming you mean something like this...\n\nhttps://optionstrat.com/build/custom/AAPL/230922P180,230922C180,230922P165,-230915P165\n\nIV drop hurts this as you are significantly long IV.\n\nIf the goal is to exit BEFORE the crush event, you would be correct in going long IV.\n\nYou might want to look into just calendarizing a straddle instead of trying to mix a long straddle with a put calendar.  You will find a more pure IV expansion play in the this, and a better risk:reward ratio. \n\nI think a better strategy to go long IV 30 days prior to earnings is to simply buy a contract (put or call) and hedge out the deltas - either through shares or balancing options.  You could use a calendarized ratio spread for this.\n\nThe vol expansion observation is great.  It's a dependable way to enter calendars imo.  I've had success with this... Buying the long side of the calendar prior to vol expansion, then waiting to sell the short side of it (or going ratio and adding to it at the peak of speculation (and IV) just before earnings.  It's like a free couple months of short premium on your calendar spread.  Unless you are too close to the money and your short leg blows up your long.  Most times though, you can roll out the short another month or so and let IV crush out completely and eventually close for profit."", ""Maybe I'm missing something, but you should be doing the opposite of your calendar spread.

options,Does using a CSP for entry into a stock really make sense?,"So I'm looking to buy TQQQ at 38.75.

I thought I should examine selling CSP expecting that either:

* A) The ETF will not hit 38.75 and I'll collect options premiums. Then repeat this until I get exercised or market moves higher. 
Or
* B) The ETF will reach my options strike 39.00 or 38.50 and I'll own the ETF at that strike. 

But when I look closer I worry that there are two outcomes that make me not want to sell the CSPs. 

* 1) The ETF one day gaps open lower past my entry level. Meaning if I just waited and watched, I would be paying a much lower entry price even after the income from the CSPs. 
* 2) The price would trade though my strike, then bounce higher - without my options being exercised. Then the market will not trade lower again and I've missed my entry level to get in this year. 

Or is there anything I can do to ensure I get in? If I decide to close to exit my CSP, that means it's very close to the money and I will have lost money on the options - meaning I was better off not messing with the options in the first place.

options,Monday Gas Deja vu,"I've noticed a consistent pattern this year. Almost every weekend brings a new forecast of hotter weather somewhere in the U.S., and by Monday, gas prices invariably shoot up.

This week's prediction from NOAA hints at a scorching August for the East Coast, triggering a sudden 7% surge in gas prices.

While my October NG call positions benefit from this uptick, I remain skeptical about high gas prices throughout the year. Sure, extreme weather might impede inventory growth, but without a significant reduction in production, it's tough to envision avoiding an oversupply.

To spice up my gas market observations, I've opted for a September ratio spread on KOLD: buying 10 Calls at $60 and selling 30 Calls at $73. This move credits me $432.

My rationale? I anticipate a decline in gas prices, pushing KOLD upwards. But given the 39 days left to expiration and the current heatwave, I'm not banking on an immediate plunge. It's plausible, but I suspect it might be a bit down the road.

As is my custom, I've earmarked $30k for this strategy, utilizing just over half. This allocation ensures satisfactory returns, even if gas defies my expectations and keeps climbing. And as a safety net? I've got October Calls at $3.5 on NG.

On a side note, [I could've leveraged the margin set for NG options as collateral](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/14w6y6v/strategies_in_the_gas_market_assessing_the_impact/). However, for now, I prefer to treat these strategies as separate entities.

You could go -4 on a 40p for the same net credit, or even like -3 45p / +3 35p.  This would consume far less BP, and be defined risk (max loss like $2.5k) vice your trade which is unlimited risk to the upside.', ""Excellent point. If we expect a gas price correction, why not also sell puts for a similar credit, especially with less collateral?  \nThere are two angles to this:  \n1. **Potential Gains**: If gas prices do drop, I'll likely make more than the initial $432 credit. A plunge to $2, especially given the current heatwave, seems improbable. This means KOLD might not even hit my $73 sales mark, or I could adjust the position (like shifting strikes or rolling to October). As volatility rises, the time decay on KOLD accelerates, favoring me.  \n2. **Potential Risks**: If I'm mistaken and gas prices soar, say, due to reduced drilling or a Gulf hurricane (it's August, after all), we could see rapid spikes. With surging volatility, having sold KOLD puts becomes a liability.  \nI dislike facing a deteriorating position alongside growing risks. I'd either need to accept the loss, reposition the puts (requiring uncertain collateral), or wait out a tumultuous October. I'm not eager to navigate a month of volatile trading with exposed KOLD puts.  \nLastly, I'm skeptical of spreads. When markets turn sour, long OTM puts might curb losses, but won't eliminate them. I'd rather go for naked puts, albeit fewer or at distant strikes."", ""In general, I agree with your points.  I like selling premium on the call side of KOLD for several reasons.

Additionally, the natural decay of BOIL and KOLD really act as a tailwind to theta decay in my opinion.\n\nMy positions are entirely naked calls on KOLD.

options,A Time Traveler's Strategy (Part 2) QQQ 1DTE ATM Problem.,"Part 1 is available at the link.[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/15byldr/a\_time\_travelers\_strategy\_long\_read\_followed\_by/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/15byldr/a_time_travelers_strategy_long_read_followed_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)I want to apologize for the very long text, but I didn't want to break this post into parts, as I consider the information it contains to be an inseparable whole.

**QQQ 1DTE ATM problem.**Probably the reason why I decided to start trading QQQ 1DTE requires some explanation.

It so happened that, with my background in trading, I have very little experience in trading on my own account. I had an open IBKR account, where I tried to conduct my experiments with options, in a quiet environment, and without unnecessary observers. The minimum amount of 25K was enough for me for these tasks, and I did not want to pump my personal account with large sums of money for investments. I reasoned that if something does not work on one lot, it is unlikely that it will work on 1000 lots. In general, I did not want to deposit more funds into the account than the amount I had initially allocated.As it became apparent to me that if you plan to steadily increase a small account, the main problem is the dispersion of the result. My initial strategy at that time was based on trading on my forecasts for short and medium term trends in stocks. And accordingly the dispersion reduction had to be done through diversification or, in other words, I had to simultaneously bet on a lot of securities in different directions and at the same time equalize the amount relative to the most expensive purchase. To put it mildly, the account amount of 25 000 dollars is not enough for such a game.

So I figured that with my small account it would be better for me to control the dispersion through a large number of consecutive attempts for a small amount of entry.It is quite natural that I came to the necessity to try to trade options on QQQ, because in this instrument the expiry occurs every working day, and at the same time each of my entries is easily equalized by the amount of the bet.

In the long run I could get the opportunity to make 200+ trades per year. That suited and inspired me.

So I started researching.

**The trading algorithm.**To begin with, I made a simple trading algorithm, which could be tested on past data and which could be easily reproduced in real trades.

Its essence is as follows.

At the close of the current trading day T0 in QQQ, I decide to buy a CALL or PUT option with expiration on the next day T1 or 1DTE ATM.

In the tests I take the calculated strike which is equal to the closing price of T0 (it is not difficult to transfer it to trades using the real closest to the calculated strike ATM).

The next day I have to place an order, which is in the system for the whole trading day T1.

I control the fact of order execution by internal cost.

With this approach I have only 3 options to close my open trade.

\-The order is executed at the price I set and I make a profit.

\- My order is not executed and the value of the option at the end of the trading day becomes equal to 0 and I get a loss = option premium paid by me.

\-The order is not executed but the value of the option at the close of trading is different from zero and I get some money back. At the same time, I do not know whether I close the trade in plus or minus, because it will depend on the point at which tomorrow's market closes on day T1.I checked the reproducibility of the test algorithm in real trades while I had such an opportunity.

And thus I need to find the answer to two questions

1-Call or PUT

2- At what price to place a Take-profit order.

**Direction Indicator.**For tests, I made an indicator, the direction of which I was going to predict. Of course, I could try to guess the direction of the closing price on the day T1, but I wanted to leave myself some room to optimize the Take-profit order in advance.

I called this indicator Vol+-, which is equal to the largest absolute value of the extremum of the current trading day, from the closing price of the previous day, expressed as a percentage and taken with its own + or - sign. According to the value of this indicator I can determine the maximum possible profit for 1 day on the purchased option.

here's the formula.Vol + - \_t1 = IF abs (High\_t1 - Close\_t0)> abs(Low\_t1- Close\_t0) then (High\_t1 - Close\_t0)/ Close\_t0\*100 else (Low\_t1- Close\_t0)/Close\_to\* 100.

**Calculating 1DTE ATM option price**

Also for the tests I need to know the price of the QQQ option 1DTE ATM for the calculated strike.

Here I made a rough assumption.

if the price as a percentage of the value of the underlying asset for the central Call SPY 1DTE ATM = Vix\*vega

Then for QQQ I have experimentally found that Call QQQ 1DTE ATM = 1.5 \* Vix \* vega or 1.5 \*0.0209 \* Vix and this as a percentage of the underlying asset price.

*Again. I realize that the statement that Central IV QQQ = 1.5\*Vix is a very rough assumption, but it is not a fatal error affecting the results of my research.*

**A period of collecting statistics and waiting for revenue.**

I took the time period from January 2, 2020 to February 2, 2023 to research and gather statistics. There are a total of 778 trading days.

The VIX range for this period was from 12.2 to 82.7.

I immediately looked at what would happen in the case of 100% guessing the direction of my indicator.

The result, is given as a fraction of the option value. The graph of profit with the cumulative total of 778 points for me turned out as follows.

https://preview.redd.it/2beo0gyy7qfb1.jpg?width=879&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bfb856330b7dd60e0bfb45583cc35789f57f270

The Vol +- result is the absolute maximum, the Close result implies that there is no Take-profit order in the trades, and all I get is the result at the closing price on the day T1.

From these positions I was satisfied with everything. Even at the Close price the result was quite acceptable, and there was still a good window for Take-profit optimization.

So I started searching for a way to predict the priority direction of tomorrow.

**Direction Prediction.**

There is a stable opinion that daily deviations on the market are distributed randomly.

During the test period of 778 trading days the number of closures greater than 0 amounted to 430 or 55.3%.  348 days or 47.7% closed in the red zone.

I have decided right away that I will look for a solution only in the market statistics. It is unlikely that trend analysis, technical or fundamental analysis will help me in predicting 1 day ahead.

In order to narrow down the infinite range of market data, I first thought about what tomorrow's priority direction is. And I really liked the analogy that I would have to predict the MOOD of tomorrow's market at the close of today's trading day.

And somehow right away I decided on my search categories.

1- Seasonality. Mood obviously depends on the day of the week, and the mood on Wednesday will of course be significantly different from the mood on Friday. I collected statistics depending on the day of the week (at some point in my research, I also used the quarter number as seasonality).

2- Past. Well just like seasonality obviously mood is influenced by the not-too-distant past. Which means I need to consider the statistics of the previous few days of trading for the underlying asset.

3-External news background or external information at the close of the current day. Here I am a supporter of the postulate of technical analysis that all news background is embedded in prices. This means that I need to include in the analysis several instruments traded on the market (it is not clear yet which ones) that provide information about the market background.

4-Information that comes to the market from the closing of the current day to the opening of the next day. It is a random value and it is absolutely impossible to predict it.

Thus, I have formed an image of the desired search result.

If we take into account that the first three points 100% determine the market mood, and the 4th point is overlaid with an additional layer has 50% probability to confirm or deny the forecast, and closes no more than 50% of all trading days. For me, it means that a well-tuned system should give at least 75% of hits, otherwise I will always doubt it.

**Predicting a ""Random"" Value.**

Since I was only interested in direction, I converted the entire parameter array at closing time T0 and the predicted output parameter Vol+ -\_T1 into the format +1 and -1, where

\+1 upward movement

\-1 downward movement.

I took the day of the week as a sequence from 1 to 5 (Monday through Friday),

Quarter, respectively, from 1 to 4.

Collecting statistics for the 778 points was also easy, I simply counted the number of +1 and -1 for the output parameter for different combinations of input parameters.

Initially I worked with a 778\*34 massif, and tried to set the influence of each input parameter separately.

And of course I got nothing. That is, as described above, I was unable to find any statistically significant patterns. In this data representation everything really looks like a random sequence.

It probably doesn't matter now how exactly I came to this decision and how long it took.

But it was physics and playing roulette in a casino that put me on the right track).

Physics helped me in that I realized that sometimes non-random quantities can masquerade as random quantities.

A prime example is the establishment of the wave nature of the electron (Thompson's 1927 experiment). Diffraction of an electron beam on a suitable lattice.

After all, if you shoot bullets from a machine gun onto a lattice with one slit and shoot a beam of electrons, the distribution behind the slit will be Gaussian and the same for both experiments.

But if we add a second slit, then only the machine gun will keep the Gaussian distribution behind the lattice, and the electron will show its wave nature.

All that remains is to attach the second slit to the +1 and -1 directions for QQQ.)))

This is where the casino came to my rescue, namely a roulette game with Red and Black bets.

Technically, coming to the casino, you can make such a bet not in two ways - red or black, but in four ways Red, Black, Same as last time, Opposite of what happened last time. In the case of the casino, our probability is not changed by such manipulations. The question is, what changes for QQQ?

I've moved on from the data presentation format

\+1 up

\-1 down

to a format

\+1 up after down

\+2 up after up

\-2 down after up

\-1 down after down

Since when processing statistics I count the number of outcomes, the indexing can be any, including letter indexes, I did it the way it was convenient for me.

The result exceeded all my expectations. If earlier in the period of statistics processing of 778 trading days absolutely nothing worked for me, now absolutely everything worked for me))). For the sake of experiment I even checked the influence of solar activity and also got some regularities in the period of statistics collection.

At that moment I tried to determine the influence of each parameter separately on the QQQ direction and used double seasonality - day of the week and number of the quarter.

I checked the collected statistics on a test period starting from the trading date of February 3, 2023.

And then I made two conclusions. (identified two problems)

1-I get a lot of false patterns (the incoming parameter, which in the period of statistics collection gives me the required 75% probability, in the test period turns into 50/50).

2- even those patterns that I can identify as true do not give me a continuous forecasting process. That is, I get a very discrete set of predictions, and I cannot make a prediction for every day.

How I solved these problems is quite difficult to put into words.

First, I will share my preliminary thoughts, and then I will tell you exactly what I did.

So, when deciding to enter a trade, we all look at a monitor that shows us the same numbers and values, but each of us only sees a unique combination of those numbers. The answer to the question of where the market will go depends on the superposition of all the views of the participants. Accordingly, in order to make a forecast, I must understand how this superposition is distributed, and making my own prediction is unnecessary and even harmful. That is, I must make a forecast without making a prediction.

In a competition between farmers to determine the weight of a steer at a glance, the same person invariably won. And the winner was not the most experienced farmer, but the secretary of the competition, who simply bookmarked the predictions of all the participants and calculated the average value. It is possible that this person could not distinguish a bull from a cow, but his forecast was always the most accurate, and he invariably won the contest.

*The way I see it, this is what Nassim Nicholas Taleb is talking about in his lengthy arguments about just buying options, and if you find a reason to buy an option, the result is instantly spoiled.*

**A Machine Learning algorithm based on statistical data, with two-stage validation and feature engineering.**Well yes that is exactly the correct name for what I ended up doing.

I put together a data set of 13 incoming parameters that are categorized:

https://preview.redd.it/3uq2s7f28qfb1.jpg?width=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be6359e0beaaf3021d1c7998ad7f43150706d1ef

all data are in the format +1\_+2\_-2\_-1

Total of 13 input parameters, from which I have collected a matrix of combinations by the degree of parameter use. Accordingly, in the beginning I took a combination when none of the parameters is used and ended with a combination when I use all the parameters. *In other words, I am not trying to establish exactly how UST5 affects the direction of QQQ, but I am investigating the effect of all combinations that contain UST5, and of course the effect of those combinations that do not contain UST5.*

It is not difficult to calculate that I got 8192 unique combinations.

https://preview.redd.it/4y6hrkwk8qfb1.jpg?width=766&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16096436b60af748c458bb30c56b1fec23de82c6

in the table the sign 0 - if the parameter is used, 1 - if the parameter is not used

Then everything is simple, (especially if you invented it yourself).

For the first time validation period for each trading day, all 8192 combinations are run, each of which separately forms a signal based on the period of collecting statistics on 778 trading days (learning period), in the learning period for each unique combination forms a final signal based on 75% probability. This run took me 6.5 hours of machine time.

And every time I thank myself that I did not decide to analyze the influence of S&P 500 components and limited myself to only 13 input parameters, because each new added input parameter increases all previously spent calculation time on the first validation period exactly in 2 times)). Keep this in mind when conducting your own tests on your home laptop.

Having obtained statistics for each of the 8192 combinations at the first validation period, I performed some clever manipulations (I left those combinations that gave a result for the first validation period greater than 75% and threw out those that gave exactly 100%). Here I had to eliminate false patterns. These logical manipulations in a language I don't speak are properly called feature engineering. In the end, I was left with 358 combinations, which I checked simultaneously on the first and second validation period. The final signal was formed as a superposition of signals for each trading day from the 358 combinations I found, which individually form a signal according to the same 778 points of statistics collection with the same criterion of 75%. As a result of all the actions performed, the probabilities of hitting on two validation periods coincided.

And voila I have a predictive system that gives a hit probability of predicting the direction of tomorrow no worse than 75%.

Well, now it is clear where AI creators for the stock market should dig and what kind of shovel they should choose.

Without thinking much about optimization I made a trading pencil test where the starting account was 10,000, limit per trade $1000. And the account profile for 120 trading days looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/3u29w9vg8qfb1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c691d8fbe75a54d9ea20e61eb27800231a6ed52

and this despite the fact that in these calculations I closed my open deals at the worst variant - at the closing price of the next day.

I have always been of the opinion that if you start to invent something, you should immediately try to make money in real trading. It is possible to learn all the secrets of the universe in parallel with the fascinating process of making profit.

If I had not been disconnected from options trading at the time of my discovery, I would have indulged in pleasant thoughts about the advantages and disadvantages of buying a vertical spread before buying a simple ATM option, followed by a Take-profit order. And then I would briefly ponder, at what point I realize that my system has failed and it's time for me to return some of the money spent on the option premium through a Stop-Loss order.In any case, I liked this chart very much.

It's no problem for me to write a technical task, order a trading robot, so that sitting in the evenings in a beach bar, once a month to check the status of your option account in a mobile phone application, realizing that you have organized a decent pension and passive income for only $10,000 at the risk of losing only $1,000 a day. And i do all this while the rest of us continue to watch the trades in real time.

I probably wouldn't even be writing these posts.

But life has taken a different course. Bidding on my own account was closed to me. So I took the first step.

I ran my model through Kelly Criterion.

I can't even imagine what kind of games John Larry Kelly Jr. played. So that the mathematical expectation is positive, and the probability is known, and the exact payoff in case of success is known.

But I got one thing right.

Kelly criterion allows you to determine how well your game strategy is assembled. To do this, you need to assume that you bet a percentage of your own account every time.

If everything is OK, your income profile starts to resemble a geometric progression function (many people call it an exponent).

I didn't get trifled with and in the test calculations I left the starting amount of $10,000, removed the limit on one bet, and set the bet level as a percentage of the account at 25% of the account.

Result:

options,Sustainable?,"Sorry if this is a newb question. I've been trading vertical spreads since January and doing well so far. I started small, increased the volume once I felt comfortable with the process and managing the inevitable losing trades. I'm ready for a larger increase but I can't help feeling like I'm missing something. My procedure has been as follows:

1. Buy vertical options between 30-60 days till expiration
2. Average account risk per position is 10% (max I will ever go to is 15%) 
3. Balance bull and bear positions
4. Automatic close orders at 50% profit
5. At 21 days till expiration, if winning, close position. If losing, roll for credit if possible, if not possible and not ITM then either close right then or monitor for a better exit point. If losing, ITM, and no roll potential, then close. 

My average trade lasts 10.2 days. 
Average win rate is 90.4% (average P50 is 86.2%). 
Average return on risk is 5.5% (including losers). 
Average completed trades per month has been 28. 
Average return on account value per trade has been 0.55%. 
0.55% x 28 trades per month gives me an expected monthly return on account value of 15.4%. 

Since January I have averaged a monthly return of 14.5% each month, pretty close to my expected return minus brokerage fees

It seems logical that if I increase my account value by 10x and keep everything else the same then I should increase my monthly earnings by 10x. 

Please tell me why I should not do this. Thanks

As the price of TQQQ goes down the demand for those contracts decreases and the bid quantity will decrease along with it.  If TQQQ keeps dropping eventually there will no longer be any offers at $2.65, but there might be a lot of demand to buy those contracts for only $2.60.  The highest bid drops to $2.60 and the bid quantity for the highest bid appears to go up without any trades at that strike and expiration.\n\nThe bid quantity for the highest bid is not that important unless you are planning to place a big sell order at the bid price and don't want to go any lower.

options,Has anyone ever seen IV priced lower than realised volatility ? and best strategies in these times,"The markets where I trade have rock bottom IV's (10% - 11%) , to give more context IVP is close to 7% - 8%. Translating that to a weekly basis, IV turns out to be \~1.4% (10%\*(1/sq. root 52). On a decent day of the week you may get a 0.7% to 1.00% move relatively frequently and easily, and have observed that selling options in this market is not very profitable given realised movements in the index come very close to 1.4% and exceeds 1.4% 3 outta 5 times & of course the shallow Vol makes theta decay relatively slow.

So I have tried using calendar & diagonal spreads instead of my go to credit spreads & Iron condors. My goal is to roll my weekly sell leg 4 times a month and collect double or slightly more than my debit paid to buy the monthly option. If there is any IV expansion the long monthlies would benefit more than the short weeklies. 

In the past 2 months the index has rallied quiet a bit (Nifty 50) and has seen some rejections from the higher levels so it's sort of consolidating right now. My view is that there might be some decent correction in the index like 5%-7% given a decent catalyst like higher than expected inflation or the central bank announcing a surprised rate hike (it's likely as they said they are watching vegetable inflation very closely and are forecasting higher inflation in the next 2 quarters given anticipated poor monsoons). Given all of this the forward P/E multiple is in the 21 - 22 range and seems to bake in some decent EPS growth and is priced a very cozy soft landing (personally feel there are more risks of disappointment as it'll be very hard to orchestrate a soft-landing).

Given the above info and view on the underlying are diagonals/calendars the best strategies to trade ? If you folks have any other suggestions or alternative strategies pls drop them in the comments !

options,"A PMCC variation -LEAPS but instead of Selling Short Calls against them, I open Call Credit Spreads","I was hoping to get thoughts on this strategy or to see if someone has any experience with it. 

Basically its a PMCC setup, but instead of just selling individual short calls against the LEAPS, I would actually open call credit spreads to cap the losses on the short calls during times of upward movements where the short call would skyrocket (causing me losses) before theta could get me to profit, thus preventing me from actually collecting premium to make back what I paid for the LEAPS. 

A simple setup example is a 484 DTE, Deep ITM call with an ask price of around $100 ($10,000 in total premium paid). 

Then open short dated call credit spreads around 7-45 DTE where the STO call has around a 90%+ chance of profit (I could also open many more contracts than I have LEAPS using collateral). 

The way I see it, if the LEAPS go up during an upswing, instead of a single short call rapidly gaining in value (causing me to lose profits when buying to close or rolling), the credit spread would cap the maximum loss. This would also give me a chance to close my LEAPS if I wanted to take some profit off the table without leaving a single short call naked (which I cannot do yet on my brokerage) since I bought those extra calls as part of the call credit spread. (A bonus is if you buy some cheap protective puts in case of black swan market tanks (like during the covid crash) each day, the option graph looks like a straddle.)

Let me know if I need to go into any more details in the comments. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

&#x200B;","['This is something I‚Äôve thought about but never experimented with. \n\nWould love to hear from someone who has put this idea into practice.', 'When I think of various options strategies, I like to asses what each individual contract is doing. What is the benefit of the far OTM long call?\n\nAnd have you thought about ratios, such as perhaps selling 2 short OTM puts per LEAP, but then maybe buying 2+ further OTM calls to compensate?', 'I got wrecked on this with Amazon back when it was $3700. Some big news event was like summer of 2021 blew past my call credit spreads massive losses. I was doing like 10 to 1 or something ridiculous. 1 massive leap call option ITM and a shit ton of call credit spreads.\n\nIf you keep the call credit spreads numbers controlled it should work. I would skew delta positive all the time. Even on a drawdown in the stock to prevent a whipsaw effect.', 'The risk of the short is already capped by the other half of the credit spread. To me these are two separate positions on the same ticker. What am I missing?', ""I've been doing it on ToS via paper trading. Its been relatively effective. It's just frustrating during downward corrections because my LEAPS can lose 20% easily then I'm waiting for a while to get those gains back. In my main brokerage I just sell credit spreads on QQQ based on established directions. When directions change I will manage my position carefully then leg into an IC to hedge then keep selling credit spread based on the new established direction. The reason I want to know about the LEAPS aspect, is because during short bull markets, it could actually provide enough daily/weekly income to do this full time. \n\nBut if you want to put it into practice, definitely use ToS paper trading feature!"", 'You‚Äôre referring to the far OTM long call that‚Äôs part of the credit spread? It‚Äôs simply a way to increase my position size. If I only have enough capital for 1 LEAPS contract then I can only sell one short call. If I instead use credit spreads, I can open up as many contracts as I have collateral for depending on the size of the spread. So I get the profit from the LEAPS of the stock goes up, but profit from the multiple call credit spreads when the stock goes down. While the stock goes up, the extra calls I bought to make it a spread cap my losses of the short calls I‚Äôm selling', 'But if you had an Amazon LEAP those gains should‚Äôve helped dampen those losses or even surpass them correct? And that‚Äôs also why I only do credit spreads on ETFs üòÇ \n\nHad one thru NVDA earnings and still came out profitable. But that one definitely made me sweat a little haha', ""Yeah the Amazon ITM call kept me in the game, so I could bounce back. I was still down bad it's all about the delta. Delta is going to skew you short a lot if it goes past the call credit spreads in a crazy event. An ITM call is going to give you at most a delta of 0.95 against a bunch of credit spreads still going to be short here.  I think the spread was $20 wide and I had ten of them, so it was a $20,000 loss and the ITM call gained like $10k to $12k so $8,000 loss. It was so long ago forgot the numbers exactly. I was just saying don't get greedy on the call credit spreads don't oversell here.""]"
options,Illiquid options - did I screw myself?,"Hello I have a question, which I can thankfully still be philosophical about (smallish position initiated).

I have opened a position bought put $5 strike 06/20'25 expiry for 45-46c .(PLTR).

The underlying has depreciated today (-8%: PLTR $15.3 -> $14.1), but the option price has not moved a hair, despite the delta being -0,04. The bid-ask is still 40bid-46ask. The only thing which has happened is that yesterday (@$15.3) the ask was in the 1000s with the bid being in the 10s, where as now (@$14.1) it is the opposite...

Is this ""just"" the way illiquid options behave? Or did I majorly overpay?

Thank you for any insight.

edit: spelling","[""Why are you saying these are illiquid?  They are not.  Current market is .40/.45, over 500 up.  This is a very tight market, and you would likely be filled in between this market as well.\n\nWhy these didn't go up in value had nothing to do with liquidity, but for the reasons u/PapaCharlie9 mentioned."", 'Liquidity is not an issue as others have pointed out.  The discussion can be about probabilities as the Delta is -.05 for this strike is an approximate 5% probability the option will be ITM and have some amount of intrinsic value in June of 2025.  Opening this at a higher Delta may result in a more responsive reaction to the ticker price moves.  \n\nLong dated LEAPS that are well OTM tend to move more slowly based on how far out in time they are traded.  You indicate this was just opened, but with over 650 days to go this trade has a lot of time to play out.', 'I buy LEAPS at the money most of the time, those move well. Never OTM or deep OTM.', ""Illiquid with single digit delta leads to exactly what you are seeing.\n\nYou understand that a $1 change in PLTR would only move the contract price by 4 cents **at most**? Since the price action you mentioned was only 40 cents, .40 x .04 = 0.016 is the *maximum* you might see the bid change. And if that amount is less than the profit margin the market maker builds into the bid/ask, nothing is going to change in the bid. Otherwise the MM would be leaving money on the table. Illiquid means the MM has little or no competition, so they can keep profit margins high.\n\nAnd that is without even considering theta.\n\nWhy do you have 2025 OTM contracts? It's not a good idea to open any kind of contract more than 60 DTE, but for sure don't do that with OTM contracts."", ""Yeah bro. Stale money. Learn and move on. \n\nChances are, the second you close, it's gonna take off."", 'I am saying it is illiquid because despite a $1.2 (8%) move in the underlying the option did not change the bid-ask despite the fact that the price should have moved by almost 5c going off of the delta. Also the open interest was in the 10s yesterday.\n\nI have some VZ options and those move when the underlying moves by cents, hence why I thought this is a liquidity problem.', 'Hi any idea about LEAPS options volume ?', 'Thank you, the ""agile"" reaction to price of the 06/20\'25 puts seems to end at $10 strike, so this makes much sense.', 'yikes', 'Still buying leaps with rates this high? \n\nDoes the higher cost of carry not bother you?']"

options,Selling really deep ITM covered calls with low cost basis,"I wanted to run this by the sub to see if I'm missing something here. I run the wheel strategy pretty successfully and it's also something I'm comfortable with right now.

On Friday, I got assigned AMZN $141p. However, I've been successful with AMZN puts for a few months now and haven't been assigned. When I add up all the premium I've gained and do the math on my true cost basis, it brings the $141 down to around $131.

If I were to sell an AMZN covered call today for 8/18 at the $131 strike, my premium would be $9.40. This brings my cost basis down even further to like $122 -- so you can sit there and play the game all day with premium dropping the cost basis the further you go.

What's the downside to this? Am I missing something? It seems too lucrative. Is it just because I've been successfully not getting assigned for awhile?

If you want to make yourself feel better by cooking the cost basis books in this way, go ahead. Personally, I prefer to be more skeptical of such mind-tricks.

Second Tool: "" Portfolio Analysis"";

There are many use cases to this tool. You can input a list of option positions and stock long/short positions and value your portfolio at any point in the future (given your expectations about the underlying stock prices min/expected/max).

If you want to focus on just one underlying stock, this allows you to visualise classic option strategies as you get close to expiry like the ""bull call spread"" below.

options,Interactive Brokers Options Level Equity requirements,"Hello,

I am very sorry if this has been asked before but I for some reason just cannot find all the appropriate information online or on their website. I am a customer of Questrade in Canada but recently has just had enough of the ridiculous commissions/fees associated with options trading so wanted to change to IBKR (even though i really dislike the interface haha)

I am wondering if anyone could help me with these questions? (Specifically talking about IBKR Canada)

1. In Questrade, you need a minimum equity of $5000 for options level 3, and minimum $25,000 for level 4, which lets you now do naked short options. (I'm really only interested in short puts for the wheel, but if the fees aren't ridiculous I would like to do strangles again). Does IBKR have these same minimum equity requirements? And it looks like for shorting puts, IBKR classified it as a level 3 only?
2. Is there really no assignment fee, even for Canadian equities?
3. Currently on Questrade, i need to subscribe to the active trader pricing plan to get reduced commissions charge on options trading, but it looks like IBKR doesn't have such a thing? I.e. you don't really need to be subscribed to a special plan to get discount on the options commissions? It's just the same fee (tiered) for everyone?
4. Is there a data plan fee? I really just need live options data for Canada
5. I think tastyworks allows you to close options for free? Does IBKR have such a thing or is it just the same commissions for open and closing?

Thank you very much!

options,I'm quite fond of PLUG. It's truly one-of-a-kind.,"Over its 23-year tenure as a publicly traded company, PLUG hasn't reported a single profitable quarter ‚Äì **that's a whopping 96 straight quarters with a negative EPS!** Now, that's something not many can claim.

In 73% of their earnings reports, the results fall short of expectations. The last time they actually impressed analysts? November 2020.

And this is precisely what draws me to this stock. Post-report, the stock takes a dip, yet there remains a significant implied volatility in the far-out OTM calls. Perhaps the individuals who offloaded these calls to the hopefuls ahead of the report are now reaping their rewards and freeing up their collateral.

I tend to seize this chance to offload these calls at a premium. This round, I parted with the 09/15 Calls at $15 for a cool $7. Regrettably, I managed to unload only 165 contracts. I had hoped for more, but there were no takers.

Sticking to my routine, I purchased calls closer to the strike ‚Äì 55 contracts at the $12.5 mark. This is in line with my go-to 1:3 ratio spread tactic. That's a credit of $275.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I have a soft spot for PLUG. In a couple of weeks, its trajectory might tilt upwards again, potentially surpassing $12.5 as expiration looms. I'm banking on this pattern.

I had considerable success with a similar strategy just last quarter. That time, I settled for the $10 strike.

options,Butterflies & Iron Condors: Assignment Risk vs. Duration & Stock Selection,"TIA & Apologies in advance for any stupidity, trying to learn ahead of any real investment.

I‚Äôve been paper trading butterflies & IC‚Äôs on TOS (delayed) data on a weekly basis and looking to move up to a small account next month.

I am wary of assignment risk and looking to get advice on mitigating this risk via DTE duration or cheaper stock selection, but can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù market behavior via TOS paper data / bugs.

**STRATEGIES**

Butterflies = $3-5 width with one bought call leg up to $5 ITM, targeting exit at 25-50% max profit

Iron Condor = $3-10 width, inside legs of puts / calls \~ 0.30 Delta, targeting to keep 25-50% of premium

**DURATION OF TRADE VS. ASSIGNMENT RISK**

**Q1: Do you recommend starting with 30-45 DTE over 5-10 DTE to limit risk of early assignment? Or am I being overly cautious about early assignments vs another factor?**

Assumptions:

\-  With 5-10 DTE, I‚Äôm waiting until expiration day to reach my profit target, increasing the chance of assignment and limiting my exits to expiration day

\- With 30-45 DTE the advantage is taking profit 3-10 days before expiration, lowering assignment risk and having multiple days to find a buyer if a less liquid stock

**STOCK SELECTION & EXITING TRADES**

**Q2: Which stocks under $150, if any, would you recommend for these types of trades as far as liquidity in exiting BF‚Äôs & IC‚Äôs? (ex: AMZN, IBM, GOOGL)**

**Q3: Does your recommendation change with 0-1 days vs. 3-10 day exit window scenario?**

Context:

\- Been paper trading with SPY & QQQ successfully, but would prefer to start with a stock under $150 in the chance of assignment.

\- I‚Äôve gotten ‚Äústuck‚Äù trying to get out of both IC‚Äôs and butterflies in IWM and INTC on weekly trades; sometimes it‚Äôs low volume but it also seems like data / bug issues, which leaves me unsure.

Again, TIA","['if you are this worried about early assignment risk then your delta is too high', 'You might want to walk through some ""what ifs"" for possible assignment.\n\nEg, I have a long call butterfly, and I\'m assigned on 1 or 2 of the short legs.

A week later my account is debited for the dividend I owed while I was short.\n\nEg, I sold an iron condor, and the put went ITM and got assigned.  The next day, I sold a covered put against my ITM long put (so the option sale will generate some cash T+1 and reduce the amount of the overnight margin loan while the sale for shares settles T+2).  I ended up paying $15 in margin loan interest plus a $5 assignment fee.\n\nThe point is, if you better understand the actual costs/benefits of assignment, that should help determine the costs you are willing to incur to work around it.\n\nIf you\'re worried about early assignment, then yes, adding duration tends to help.  I think long-dated butterflies are more burden than benefit.  And I can\'t see a good case for selling-to-open an OTM iron condor (either establish the verticals separately, sell more high-IV puts, or use synthetic spreads to capture the interest and gamma in the short calls rather than just the low-IV extrinsic in the OTM equity calls)\n\nI\'m not sure about specific underlyings, but if you\'re worried about assignment, you can simplify things by avoiding underlyings paying a dividend.', 'Thanks.

options,Help understanding the risk of early assignment.,"I am looking at a possible trade. TSLA put credit spread. But it would be deep in the money. 

Buy 25 contracts of Jan 21 24 450p. ($200)
Sell 25 contracts of Jan 21 24 483.33p. ($230) 

Credit of $75,000.

Max risk $8,325.

Now I'm just learning so be gentle. 

First is I get the credit immediately, right? 

Second, that risk means if it's below 450 on Jan 21, I will owe the difference between the two strikes of 33.33, times 100 shares, times the 25 contracts. $83,325? The one I sold will get assigned, so I will have to buy shares at 483.33, but I can sell shares at 450 because of my bought put. Right? 

If it's between the two strikes, I can sell the shares at the current price, lets say 465, so I lose the difference between 465 and 483.33, or 18.33 times 2500 = $45,825, but this comes out of my original credit of $75,000, so I still profit nearly 30k? 

Above 483.33 doesn't matter to me as both contracts will expire worthless and I just keep the original 75k?

Now with all that being said, what is the likelihood of getting assigned early on this trade? If that happens say in 2 months and the price is at 350, does that guarantee max risk instantly?

options,Is it even lucrative to sell Credit Spreads without margin instead of doing the wheel?,"Hi,

let's say I don't want to use margin by now. 

If I do a credit spread on a cash account on IBKR (yes that's allowed if I can afford the short leg), I always have to hold the money for the short leg. Without using margin, as I said, I have to always hold the money for the short leg of credit spreads.

But if I get rather less money with buying a long leg than if I did the wheel strategy AND had to hold the money that can't be used any other way while the trade is open, under regular circumstances is it even possible to gain more profit with cash covered credit spreads than with the wheel strategy? I somehow doubt it, but maybe I'm just not seeing this right. 

Thanks for any productive answer :)

options,IV After FDA Approval,"Hey y‚Äôall! A little while back, my friend and I decided to test out a new strategy which was basically shorting companies which got FDA approval the day they got approved around 11-12 ish. We were able to grab some amazing profits and were extremely profitable in the end. Now, I am wondering if I can do the same with puts instead of just directly shorting shares. Would IV be low after a company got approval? I know IV always falls after things like ER, but I wasn‚Äôt so sure of approvals since they don‚Äôt have a specified time when they‚Äôre supposed to be released. Thanks!","['I\'m not an expert like some of these people on this sub, but I do have a little robot man that tells me things that are right sometimes. here\'s what he says about implied volatility\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Implied volatility (IV) is a measure of the market\'s expectation for future price fluctuations of a stock or option. It\'s a critical component in determining option prices, as it reflects the market\'s perception of uncertainty or risk. Unlike historical volatility, which is calculated from past price movements, implied volatility is derived from the option\'s current market price.  \n>  \n>Implied volatility is not directly calculated but is instead backed out from the option\'s price using an options pricing model. The most commonly used model for this purpose is the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model considers various factors, including the current stock price, the option\'s strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and the option\'s price. By inputting all these variables into the model, you can solve for the implied volatility that would make the theoretical option price match the observed market price.  \n>  \n>In mathematical terms, the Black-Scholes formula for European call and put options is as follows:  \n>  \n>C = S \\* N(d1) - X \\* e\\^(-r \\* T) \\* N(d2)  \n>  \n>P = X \\* e\\^(-r \\* T) \\* N(-d2) - S \\* N(-d1)  \n>  \n>Where:  \n>  \n>C is the call option price  \n>  \n>P is the put option price  \n>  \n>S is the current stock price  \n>  \n>X is the option\'s strike price  \n>  \n>T is the time to expiration (in years)  \n>  \n>r is the risk-free interest rate  \n>  \n>N(d1) and N(d2) are cumulative standard normal distribution functions of d1 and d2  \n>  \n>The formulas involve the term ""d1"" and ""d2,"" which are calculated as follows:  \n>  \n>d1 = (ln(S / X) + (r + 0.5 \\* IV\\^2) \\* T) / (IV \\* sqrt(T))  \n>  \n>d2 = d1 - IV \\* sqrt(T)  \n>  \n>Given that option prices are publicly available, and the other variables (stock price, strike price, time to expiration, interest rate) are also known or easily obtainable, you can use numerical methods like the Newton-Raphson method or optimization algorithms to solve for the implied volatility.  \n>  \n>Keep in mind that the Black-Scholes model assumes certain simplifications, such as constant volatility and continuous trading, which might not fully capture real-world market dynamics. As a result, implied volatility calculated using this model may differ from the actual market perception. Traders and analysts often use implied volatility as a gauge of market sentiment and potential pricing discrepancies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My take:** Essentially, IV will be higher if people are expecting a movement. So if a healthcare company were to get FDA approval you would first read about it on [FDA.gov](https://FDA.gov) maybe or the healthcare company\'s own site if you were already following them, then second you would hear about it on Financial market news networks like Bloomberg, Then you might hear about it on Reddit. All this time, theoretically, the IV should be going up and then by the time it\'s on Reddit it\'s probably coming down.\n\nIt\'s complicated though different sectors are going to act and react differently and the process of acquiring news from different sectors as well. If you\'re looking to do this with healthcare companies I think you would have to be in pretty deep, i.e. following when they apply, following the process of the clinical trials, following the updates, and then finally finding the approval/rejection as the news breaks. Seems like there might be better sectors for doing something like this.\n\nIt kind of sounds like a more complicated earnings play.\n\nI\'ve seen these healthcare stocks drop big after canceling a trial because of bad results and FDA rejection as well... so something else to think about maybe.\n\nI\'m sure there\'s others on this sub that can provide better/more nuanced information than me. I\'m just a novice learning the ropes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** It also depends on the magnitude of the company. How many people are following it? Institutional investors? Is this the Pfizer oral covid anti-viral with a CNN marketing campaign or is it some shitty little company that applied for an experimental Psychedelic Therapy Treatment? The answer to that question could help determine how big and/or how long the run is before it starts to come back down. A Pfizer could go up all day, but a CYBN will probably go up by 60%, for about ten minutes. That\'s when your IV really explodes and you lose 90% of your option\'s value while you\'re left scratching your head going ""WTF happened?""', 'Can you share some of these companies and the date of the events? So we can check the IV\nCongrats!', ""Remember, IV is a calculation of the expected volitility being reflected in the spot price  and spread of the options.  IV does not have any inertia of it's own.  It can come down instantly.\n\nI find that any residual volitility expressed after a steep move to be  explained more by the spread in the premium rather than the price variation of the underlying.  In other words, good luck catching a fill that captures any real decay in price action.\n\nI'm not saying there is nothing there. Indeed, I looked into using options to catch the fade after a big news run-up, specifically looking how long to wait for the spread to come in before buying contracts. It looks like there could be some money there, but it was too much of just a direction guess for me."", ""That volatility will certainly be priced into the puts (and calls). Actually, it will probably be overpriced by 50-100%.\n\nIf you're having success doing what you're doing, I'd stick with it. \n\nMaybe even consider writing some of those expensive puts against your short shares, i.e., covered puts."", 'Usually IV starts getting going down after big events like earnings, dividends etc. but for FDA approvals I don‚Äôt know.

options,Would it ever be wise to short an index?,"Just looking for some input and views from others on shorting/betting against indexes through options. I am currently bearish. I personally don't do and feel like the cards are stacked against you. To me it'd be better to short individual sectors instead. I feel like the cards are stacked since the companies in indexes always change. Many times companies are removed for under performance and added when over performing. That alone seems like the cards are stacked against you as best of breed will always eventually end up in the index while worst of breed will be given the boot. Second a lot of times in the market there are winners and losers and hedge funds etc will rotate/rebalance their portfolios which could leave the market sideways or not underperforming in a drastic measure. I personally in the past would hedge my bullish bets with bets against indexes in case I got caught with my pants down. But with the rise of etfs use that instead of the index. Example lets say I'm overweight semis. To hedge I would just buy puts on SOXL. To me it is better to more directly hedge with my most overweight positions. Just looking to see what others do and what their opinions are?

\*\*EDIT\*\*

Not looking for options tutorial and already understand options. This is more geared towards the feeling it would be foolish to ever really buy puts against something like the qqq or spy whether to bet against or as a hedge. Companies constantly rotate in and out of these indexes so the indexes always have best of breed (increasing likely hood it will go higher or that any downward momentum will be short lived (bear markets are blip in time compared to bull markets)). It seems stacked. I mean if a company is added to lets say the spy it will see more of a pop after instruments like spy rebalance add the stock to the etf which in turn raises the stock price which in turn raises the very index it is in. It seems it would be wiser to target individual sectors or instruments like xle, xlk, xlf etc etc instead of just the broad based index like the spy. Example I am in the camp that by summer of next year we will be in a mild to moderate recession (doesn't matter if you agree with that statement). Sure if I wanted to bet against the market I could buy puts on the spy ending next year. But I would think the better play would be to target individual sectors I feel would do worse during that time. Same thing lets say I don't want to bet against the market but merely want to hedge the portfolio. Once again I could buy puts on the spy. But again it would seem better lets say my portfolio was overweight financials to buy puts on something like the xlf instead. I see all these people saying market will crash any day and buying puts on things like spy and qqq.

options,Covered Calls on Company RSU / ESPP,"Between RSU and ESPP I've acquired \~1,000 shares of a large tech company. Recently, I've learned that a handful of my close colleagues are using a covered calls (CCs) to generate a 1-2%/month synthetic dividend on their company stock. It looks like some other very large tech forms (MSFT) are silent on employees selling covered calls (ie. their policy allows it, or more accurately - doesn't forbid it).

However, I just read through my company's insider trading policy and trading of any derivatives is forbidden. Blackout periods are restricted only to c-suite and senior exec, but the derivatives trading rule applies to all employees. For the policy to forbid short selling makes complete sense to me - the conflict of interest and bad public message that sends is obvious. However, forbidding any calls, especially CCs, seems silly. The policy strongly recommends employees retain their vested stock, yet there is obviously nothing against selling it. Therefore forbidding covered calls just removes a potential income stream from those devoted to the company - it would seem I'm better off selling to diversify, and using CCs on everything else I hold.

Some of my colleagues have been doing CCs for 4+ years without issue. Given that the strategy is used consistently throughout the year (not boom/bust around earnings), it would seem to follow that it's free of being tainted with insider info (we're all low-level engineers with none). So, for something that doesn't fall under the classic definition of insider trading (e.g. not all company's forbid calls/CCs), but violates the company policy, what is the true risk? Getting fired for violating policy seems like an obvious one. But I'm curious whether violating the policy alone would get you flagged with the SEC if the CC strategy was being done without any insider info?","['Then SEC only cares if you trade on inside information. This strategy is pretty defensible there. The only risk is getting fired for violating the internal policy.

options,Can I get some help understanding the options portion of my job offer please??,"Do I have to actually purchase the shares or does the vesting mean they are given/awarded as I pass the timeline milestones?

The pertinent part of the offer read as such:

‚ÄúThe Company will recommend that the Company Board of Directors (""Board"") grant you an option to purchase up to XXXXXX shares of the Company's Common Stock, with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant as determined by the Board in accordance with applicable law, which would vest as follows:

‚ÄúVesting over a four (4) year period starting on the Vesting Start Date, with the first twenty-five percent (25%) of such total number of Option Shares vesting on the first anniversary of the Vesting Start Date (the ‚ÄúFirst Vesting Date‚Äù), and the remaining Option Shares vesting in twelve (12) equal installments (at the end of each successive three (3) month period following the First Vesting Date), over the three (3) year period immediately following the First Vesting Date; provided, that, in each case, the Continuous Service of the Participant has not terminated prior to the relevant vesting date.

‚ÄúThe exact number of options, vesting schedule and strike price are subject to approval by the Board, and such option will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Company's applicable equity incentive plan and form of stock option agreement.‚Äù

This person was at a high level at a company, with tons of stock options at low, low strike price, and the company stock was booming...all good so far, right ?\n\nSo then he starts vesting and is able to exercise these stock awards, which he does - but there\'s a pretty lengthy lockout period where he\'s not allowed to sell the shares he\'s acquired.

So you basically don\'t have a choice if you want to convert them into spendable money.\n\nA question you should clarify with your employer (or the administrator handling your equity compensation, which is almost always E\\*trade), is if they will honor ""Same Day Sales"". What that means is that you exercise the option and sell the shares the same day, using the proceeds of the share sale to cover the expense of exercise. You keep the difference in cash.\n\nThere are tax consequences to every aspect of equity compensation, with several clocks that start at various times, like grant date, vesting date, exercise date, etc. Depending on the type of option you are granted, there can be significant, and in extreme cases, [bankrupting tax consequences](https://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-tech-taxes-story.html) that you should be aware of.

options,Covered Call Tax Implications (U.S.),"I'm trying to figure out how I need to fix this.  I was the idiot who had covered calls on Nvidia.  I will be assigned with a small profit, so no harm done, or so I thought.  While the stock was shooting up over the summer, my last roll sold for $134,000.  My earlier rolls generated losses of $130,000.  So there would be a gain of $4000, which seems about right.

However, my last roll does not expire until Jan 2024.  So, did I screw myself, as I'll have a $130,000 loss for this tax year, but a $134,000 gain for next year?  When reading about this, the proceeds from a covered call assignment are the strike price + the premium.  That would be $205 \* 600 + $134,000.  When I subtract the basis, it means that I'd have to pay taxes on $129,000 of gains that I used to buy-to-close.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-08-18.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

options,Call prices and interest rates,"I started trading options in 2020. Since then I've seen put prices consistently higher than calls for the same strike and underlying. That makes sense in that stocks historically are riskier to the downside. I don't recall call prices being consistently higher across the board, except for volatile meme stocks GME etc.

I've read that this has to do with interest rates, but I'm wondering how that actually works / what's the logic behind it?

Looking at the SPY 9/15 contracts, the ATM call (437C, $8.24) has a slightly higher IV of 14.86% compared to the 437P ($6.64) at 14.85% and is trading for $1.60 more than the put. Does this imply there is a tiny amount of call skew, in addition to whatever might be at play with interest rates?

The rho on the call is .1691, so if the 10YR treasury went from 4.25% down to 0.25%, the call would lose $0.67, making it trade at $7.57. The put with a rho of -.1637 would simultaneously gain $0.65, making it $7.29. This is obviously an oversimplified hypothetical scenario, but still, the interest rates do not account for the higher call price.","['You asked for the logic behind it. Well, someone has to hold the stock you own the call for, which means they have to tie their money up in that stock instead of having it in a T Bill (more or less the risk free interest rate). They expect compensation for this. When TBills pay over 4% (now) instead of 0.1% (couple years ago) they expect more compensation. They receive this compensation when you pay them for the call.\n\nThis is all covered in Black/Sch.\n\nYou can look at box spreads to understand the relationship with interest rates better. [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp)', ""> I've read that this has to do with interest rates, but I'm wondering how that actually works / what's the logic behind it?\n\nSome relevant comments to review, make sure you read Ken's reply to the reply, which has the fuller explanation:\n\n[Ken on interest rates vs. puts/calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/104swhs/comment/j381obo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"", 'Why would you say stocks are historically riskier to the downside? the market has grown at like 8% yr/yr for 120 years.', '> That makes sense in that stocks historically are riskier to the downside.\n\nThat\'s a bit of a confusing statement. That can\'t literally be true, as that would be exploitable. But if you meant something along the lines of people preferring to buy insurance against max drawdown events, which drives up demand on puts, that would be closer to the mark. But it\'s important to emphasize this is a *behavioral preference* of market participants, not a intrinsic characteristic of equity risk.\n\nAlternatively, if what you meant is the old saying about how the equity market is, ""Stairs up, elevator down,"" that would be fine also. Declines tend to be compressed in time compared to rallies, for constant magnitude, but that doesn\'t mean ""riskier to the downside"", unless you also define a narrow window of time.', 'More people/institutions are long stocks than short, so there is more demand for downside protection (put). More demand, higher price.', 'Like dividends if you get dividends from company holding stock selling cc gets adjusted.\n\nAs selling puts need more for compensation since no dividend.', 'It\'s really mainly that you look at ATMS. If you have non zero dividends and interest rates, you will only have equal prices (ignoring that for American markets, put call parity doesn\'t hold neatly), if you are ATMF. \n\nWith low interest rates, dividends were above interest rates, hence ATMF was below ATMS and ATMS puts were more ""expensive"" as calls. \n\nRight now, rates are above dividend yields (for spy) and ATMF is above ATMS. Therefore, ATMS calls are more ""expensive"" compared to puts. \n\nIn this particular case, do you have time stamps? I would say the prices and IV were not computed at the exact same time because the price difference is larger than it should be for the options you provided.', ""Ken makes another good point in there that with higher interest rates assignment on ITM put happens more frequently. It's also how to understand/remember how interest rates affect options. People are more willing to own ITM calls than stock because the cost of carry is less, while people would rather be short stock, than long a deep ITM put because the put has a cost of carry, while the short stock collects carry.\n\nIn the old days when I was a market maker there was an arb traders would do in down markets (and we're seeing alot of it now) where two traders pick two strikes with heavy open interest, crossing deep ITM put spreads with eachother. They each then exercise their (100 delta) puts. With the way assignment works they don't get assigned on all their corresponding short puts with eachother, only some of them, the rest of the assignments go out to others, and the traders that cross with eachother end up with a short stock/long put position for free that then collects carry until expiry. Money from nothing out of the assignment wheel.\n\nTraders should take off deep in the money trades (at max gain or max loss where both sides are 100 deltas) before expiry so that it doesn't happen to them. Getting assigned can make a max loss spread more than max loss as it takes a few days for your exercise on the other put to clean up the mess."", 'There is more downside volatility, i.e. stocks rise slow and fall fast.']"
options,Please comment on draft Black-Scholes-Merton Excel spreadsheet & graphics application,"I'm new to reddit in general and in particular r/options. I've lurked for years but finally decided to join and post.

I‚Äôve written a handy Black Scholes Merton pricing model in Excel. Yes, I know there are several available on here and the web already. I‚Äôve focused on the tables and graphics in my spreadsheet more than the others. Google sheets won‚Äôt work because certain graphical formats and surface graphs don‚Äôt convert.

The inputs are the usual Black-Scholes-Merton requirements; security price, strike price, volatility, risk-free rate, security yield, days to expiration. The spreadsheet calculates the BSM option price, parity price, delta, gamma, vega, rho, theta, ‚àÜ Hedge, and forward security price for both the call and put. These values are reflected in the accompanying 3D bar graph at the top of the spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet I use the \^SPX for my example (DEC 2023 expiration).

*There is also an implied volatility computation for corresponding observed call or put option prices (Newton-Raphson). Just input the observed call and put option prices. You can then paste either implied volatility cell value into the BSM input cell for volatility.*

*Also included is an implied security price computation based on the given observed call and put option prices using the put-call parity theorem. It will need* ***both*** *the corresponding observed call and put price inputs for it to work.*

¬∑ Table 1 calculates option prices, the Greeks, and forward security price for a range of security prices for the given strike price. You do need to input the initial security price and security price increment. 

¬∑ Table 2 calculates the same option values as table 1 but for a range of time decreases for the given strike price. You do need to input the initial days to expiration and the daily increment.

¬∑ Table 3 calculates the same option values as the previous tables but for a range of volatility decreases for the given strike price. You do need to input the initial volatility and the volatility increment.

¬∑ Table 4 calculates call options prices on a range of security prices and strike prices. You do need to input the initial strike price and it uses the range of stock prices supplied from Table 1.

¬∑ Table 5 calculates call option deltas on a range of security prices and strike prices. No input is needed.

¬∑ Table 6 calculates put options prices on a range of security prices and strike prices. No input is needed.

¬∑ Table 7 calculates put options deltas on a range of security prices and strike prices. No input is needed.

¬∑ There are also a series of graphs in the sheets depicting selected data from the various tables; the option Greeks, option prices & deltas, time, and volatility.

**What I need are volunteers to check my spreadsheet computational accuracy, embedded graphics appeal, and the overall look and feel.** 

The final version, post evaluation, will be made available for free on request. I‚Äôll do my best to provide an answer to any question asked.  Not sure how I‚Äôll distribute it other than as an email attachment. 

If you‚Äôd like to give me a hand, just let me know with an email or message.

options,Options Risk Management,"Does anyone have an options risk management strategy that really works (meaning it provides consistent profitability) for swing trading of long calls and puts and long and short vertical spreads? 

The ‚Äúprevailing wisdom‚Äù (which I would characterize as ‚Äúswinging for the fences‚Äù) of starting to take profits at a 100% gain (while leaving ‚Äúrunners‚Äù, if holding multiple contracts) on long naked options and debit spreads (or alternatively, when the short strike is hit for the latter), stopping out at a 50% loss, and a 90% gain/100% loss on credit spreads, leads to too low a success rate for me and too many (painful) reversals and drawdowns.  I know it should also depend on support and resistance levels, but assume those aren‚Äôt hit or broken before the profit target or stop is hit.

I‚Äôve seen some traders start taking profits on long naked options at as little as a 20% profit, while setting stops at breaks of intraday support or resistance, meaning their RTR isn‚Äôt quantified, which doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. On the other hand, if they were to set stops at, say, a 10% loss, that would result in being stopped out of too many trades and could only work for day-trading, as overnight gaps could result in losses much bigger than 10%.

I‚Äôve also seen someone (a popular guru who runs a trading alert device) who claims a high success rate and consistent profitability from a credit spread strategy (strictly bull put spreads, to wit), that starts taking profits at as little as 20%, though I‚Äôm not sure how he sets his targets.","['if you want ""consistent profitability"", go with high grade bonds, and/or companies with either proven dividend track records or high quality preferred stocks.  \n\nAnyone who claims to be an options guru is a liar.

Options just let you express that bias with a potentially more favorable risk reward. Randomly taking profit on a long position because you are up on it without the security hitting supply is technically mismanaging the position', ""I use fib levels relative to ATR. 1ATR I'm all out. 61.8 usually first take profit unless move is ultra strong. SPY is quite consistent. GOOGL too. Only big caps, QQQ SPY. I like to skip TSLA ."", 'There is no such thing is a consistent profitable strategy. If there was everyone would be doing it.', '> Does anyone have an options risk management strategy that really works (meaning it provides consistent profitability) for swing trading of long calls and puts and long and short vertical spreads?\n\nYou can have the best risk management method in all of history, and still not be profitable. Managing risk is necessary, but not sufficient, to profitability. You need to adjust your expectations. Should you do risk management? Absolutely! Will that make you profitable all by itself? No.\n\n> The ‚Äúprevailing wisdom‚Äù (which I would characterize as ‚Äúswinging for the fences‚Äù) of starting to take profits at a 100% gain (while leaving ‚Äúrunners‚Äù, if holding multiple contracts) on long naked options and debit spreads (or alternatively, when the short strike is hit for the latter), stopping out at a 50% loss, and a 90% gain/100% loss on credit spreads,\n\nThat\'s not even close to what I would consider ""prevailing wisdom."" Where did you get such aggressively loose targets? Swing trading needs *tighter* targets, if you want consistency.\n\nHere\'s the ultimate answer: **Your gain/loss targets should be set in the context of your expected value calculation.** Without any notion of expected value, any number you pick is arbitrary and won\'t lead to consistency.\n\n[Expected value explainer here](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result).\n\nExpected value forces a mathematical relationship on win rate, gain target and loss target. If you define any two, you can calculate the third. So since we are talking about risk management here, lets calculate the loss target based on an assumed win rate and gain target.\n\nLet\'s consider a long trade, where you expect an 80% win rate, double the 40% you mentioned, and for every $2500 of capital in the trade the maximum gain on the trade is $500. The question is, how much can you risk, your loss target, with those parameters?\n\nwin$ = $500\n\nwin% = 80%\n\nloss% = 100% - win% = 20%\n\nCalculate break-even loss$:\n\nEV = (win% x win$) - (loss% x loss$)\n\nForce EV to $0, since we want the break-even values:\n\n0 = (80% x $500) - (20% x loss$)\n\n20% x loss$ = 80% x $500\n\nloss$ = (80% x $500) / 20% = $2000\n\n**Conclusion**: You **must** set your loss target to be **less than** $2000 in order to make a profit on average for this trade. So to be long-term profitable on a $2500 trade, set your loss limit at something less than $2000. The tighter you set the loss limit, like $700 vs. $1000, the closer your average profit will be to the max $500.\n\nIf instead you want to start with a defined gain target and loss target and calculate you required break-even win rate, you can do that too.\n\nThis is a very simplified approach to using expected value for the sake of explanation. Usually your trades don\'t just have one outcome with one win rate. Plus the assumptions will change over time, so you may have to recalculate. But at least it gives you a general idea. This works for short (credit) trades as well. In fact, the often quoted ""credit must be at least 1/3 the width of the spread, for 30 delta verticals"" comes from exactly this kind of break-even EV calculation.', 'The best traders only have a 60% win rate, if you trade ES and want to make a living off it , you need at least $300k and 3 years of experience of full time looking at charts to have any chance of being profitable', 'Thanks for the honesty. I do all that too ‚Äî certainly I don‚Äôt risk my whole ( or even most of) my portfolio on options.', 'I‚Äôm in this boat as well.

options,"Selling long term PUTS on ""unachievable"" price ranges","Hi everyone 

Have a question and I would appreciate your insights. Say I am fan of NVDA and I believe the stock price will never cross below the price of 100. What's wrong with selling long term put options with strike price =<100 to earn some pocket money? Of course I understand that if things go south I might be in a really bad situation but statistically what are the chances a stock like NVDA (or any other high-cap established company) goes down by 70-80%? What's the catch that I struggle to see?

Thanks!","['January ‚Äò24 $95 strike out is selling for $0.10\n\nIf it expires worthless you‚Äôd make $10 (minus any commissions) on a $9,500 position.

As someone said, volatility increases.\nI think, as stock prices fall, investors see opportunity to buy as stocks fall. I focus on leaps, but this may be true for expirations few months put.', 'Cheaper to what?', 'OP u have to read carefully what some of the replies are suggesting. Don‚Äôt be confused by them. I break it down in numerical example \n\nScenario 1\n\nSay AAPL is $190 now, and maybe a LEAP call $170 is worth $22. Meaning, you agree to pay $192 for AAPL. But you only paid $2 of extrinsic value. \n\n2 outcomes: you either pay $192 to buy AAPL or paid $22 for nothing if AAPL falls below $170. But you paid $2 for extrinsic value only.\n\nScenario 2\n\nLets say AAPL is now $170, and the LEAP of $170 is now worth $5. Meaning, you agree to pay $175 for AAPL. But yet you now have to pay $5 for extrinsic value. \n\n2 outcomes: you either pay $175 to buy AAPL or paid $5 for nothing if AAPL falls below $170. But you paid a higher extrinsic value of $5.\n\nScenario 2 is a bear market than scenario 1, which scenario would you prefer to be in to buy a LEAP (assuming you believe in the stock)? Of course, it‚Äôs cheaper to buy in a bearish market. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, does it matter that you paid $5 in extrinsic value during a bearish market vs $2 extrinsic value in a Bull market? Not really, in the grand scheme of things. You would have paid less in absolute amount, as illustrated by the 2 scenarios above. In a bear market where the price of the underlying has already dropped, you stand to lose less from buying a leap, and in fact you fork out a lower absolute amount to buy a leap. \n\nThe comments that say you paid more in extrinsic value are factual, but this fact doesn‚Äôt change the fact that you‚Äôd have found a cheaper LEAP during a bear market. It‚Äôs only logical.', 'No, quite the opposite actually. \n\nWhen people buy puts, it not only increases put prices, but also call prices, it\'s what\'s called ""put-call parity"". The idea is that if people buy lots of puts, it doesn\'t mean the stock will necessarily go down, but it means there\'s a good chance the price will move a lot for a while, be it up or down. Which is why it makes calls valuable too.\n\nPut-call parity is sometimes broken, but rarely by a big factor. It\'s complicated to explain exactly why in a Reddit comment, but let\'s say that the more efficient the market is, the more call and put prices should move together with the demand for one or the other. Inefficiencies such as information asymmetry and limits to arbitrage such as limitations on short-selling can cause this relationship to break down.\n\nIn general, if you\'re really bullish during a downturn, buying the asset outright or going long on far ITM or far OTM LEAPS with little extrinsic value is preferable, depending on how much capital you wanna commit and how bullish you are.', '[deleted]', 'no', 'Good time is if you are bullish long term on underlying but see a  drop in near term. AAPL may be a good candidate', 'That‚Äôs not exactly true, in a bear market you would have been able to pay less and select an even lower strike price for a call. Furthermore, buying shares tie up 100% of capital as opposed to a LEAP which serves to lock in the price for a premium (extrinsic value) and thereby providing capital efficiency. An investor can simply use the unused capital for other purposes.', 'I should clarify my statement is for premiums as %age of stock price, not absolute value of premiun.']"

options,Playing the Long Game with Fisker (FSR): Embracing Risk in the EV Sector,"I have a soft spot for Fisker. It's a common desire to want to see the ambitious plans of this electric vehicle manufacturer come to fruition, and I confess that my sentiments are not out of the ordinary in this regard.

Today's report isn't bad, but from an investor's standpoint, it indicates that the soft spot in my heart represents a rather high-risk venture. Still, there's no shortage of individuals who relish the opportunity to invest in stocks with such explosive growth potential. It's to these people that I sold 40 September calls at a strike price of $10. And, as per usual, I picked up 10 shares myself at a strike price of $7.

I've garnered a credit of $99.

The volume is modest, and the collateral needed is minimal - less than $3k. Yet, for some reason, this trade has me feeling slightly on edge, as FSR could take off rather abruptly.

Of course, I anticipate making a few more hundred even with this volume.

options,Cash-covered call instead of call spread - disadvantages?,"Hi,

I've been thinking about the following and need some pointers as to where there might be a mistake in reasoning:

If I sell a call option, for example at a price of 45, perhaps even without having the shares in my portfolio, it may make sense to protect myself against a sharp rise in the price and to buy a call option at a higher price, for example at price 48.

Actually, wouldn't it basically lead to the same ending if I made a cash-covered call instead? So sell at price 45, but maybe say I put in an order that immediately buys the 100 shares at price 48?

What I see as a disadvantage here is the ""overrunning"" of the price, that you then may buy at a price higher than 48 and that the price could go down again and then of course you're sitting on the shares. However, if this does not happen, you save the fee for the purchased call option, which can sometimes be very high.

(For example, I sold a call in the sample portfolio for EUR 25 and bought one for EUR 17. Now the return was actually only EUR 8. Something like that could be avoided with it.)

And if you're really into the stock, if it's a good company, it's not that bad and you can go on writing covered calls while still being able to receive dividends. But in my opinion it wouldn't even happen that often, because I'd usually roll higher, if my sold option was in the money. So most of the time the upper level wouldn't even be touched, no?

&#x200B;

Am I seeing something wrong here? Or would you advise against something like that, since it often happens that the upper price is scratched, but then it falls again?

&#x200B;","['It will happen more than you think. Second if you don‚Äôt mind owning the stock, selling naked calls is basically shorting a stock. That is the opposite of what you would do if you don‚Äôt mind owning it. There‚Äôs a lot of issues with this that will have you lose more money and tying up more buying power than just using a vertical. \n\nWhen people say picking up pennies in front of a steam roller this is exactly what they mean. You open up multiple avenues of extreme risk for additional pennies. It‚Äôs also a worse return. \n\nSince a vertical has very little effect on your buying power you can continue to use that buying power in other areas for better returns. This idea increases max profit but will reserve much of your liquidity. \n\nYou are falling into an illusion of increased returns.', 'You state your question like you have a choice about it. If you don\'t cover a single-legged short call with shares, you **must** cover it was cash (buying power). Those are the only two choices, at least in the US. A vertical spread isn\'t technically ""covering"" the short leg. A vertical spread is essentially a special case in the grand scheme of shorting and covering. In a way, you can think of a vertical as the long leg is discounting the impact to buying power of the short leg.\n\nThat said, you can approximate the P/L of a single-legged short call by using a very wide vertical spread. However, your broker isn\'t stupid and may treat the wide spread as if it were a naked short call. The net impact to buying power would be essentially the same. Or your broker would deny the opening order for the wide vertical, if you are not approved to trade naked shorts.', ""the cash-covered call order is an interesting middle ground. It provides upside stock price protection, but risks overpayment if there is volatility. I'd backtest this strategy vs. others to compare total return and risk metrics. Creative thinking on your part though."", 'I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre ready to trade options', 'Have you looked into diagonal spreads?  I think the risk graph is similar to the risk graph you are trying to achieve. Take for example, MRVL, which is trading at 62.35. Rather than selling a naked  Sept 1 65 call strike for 2.80, you can also buy a Sept 22 74 call for 1.27 for a net credit of 1.53. This will reduce your margin to the size of the spread which is 9.00 or $900.  If MRVL stays below 65 by expiration date you keep the full 1.53 credit for a 17% ROI. You can also sell the following week same strike if it expires worthless since your long strikes are three weeks away. You can do this weekly all the way to Sept 22.  If MRVL rallies to 67 and you want to buy 100 shares, you can.  You should also be able to sell your long calls at this point which should have gone up in value since you will now own the underlying to cover the short 65 calls but call your broker to be 100% certain. This position would have a positive theta and negative delta just like a naked call. Vega is slightly negative and very close to neutral. You can play around with different strikes and different expiration months that will correspond to where you think the stock will be trading within a certain time frame.', ""Thank you for your answer!  \nOkay, if it's happening too often it's dumb. Yes it's true, it's basically shorting it. I just thought about doing it in very small periods of stocks I would also hold. So basically if they make a strong upward movement, where I believe it's going down again short term. But the more I think about it the more it sounds dumb to me. Because if it goes up short term nonetheless, and basically I think the stock will go up long term, I lose money. I mean I thought with rolling it would be okay. And if you have an iron condor it's also about the range of price you think it will move in.\n\nI understand now, it is not the best idea. And that I could use the buying power in another spot. I really appreciate you all telling me how it is.  \n\n\nBut could you tell me, I already asked the question beneath PapaCharlie9, but have no answer yet, lets pretend it wouldn't happen so often that the buy order was hit, if I sold a call at 45 and bought a call at 47, couldn't I make a buy order for when it hits 46 and if it bought just sell the bought call at 47 again and now it would be a covered call? I would get back circa the price I paid for the bought call, because I would have gotten even nearer to 47 when I sell it again, even if there was a sell and buy spread, depending of the remaining time of course."", ""Ah you mean it's about the margin I have. But a naked short call could theoretically rise endlessly. So you mean, I have to be approved to even go short on naked calls. But even if i would be approved, going short on a naked call could mean endless debt. How could this even be approved? No margin can cover theoretically endless losses.\n\nI mean, all of this was only partly my question. If I was approved to do calls without having the shares or with a very wide spread or however it would be possible, would it come out the same to make a regular buy order at the price I would normally place my long leg (taking in the disadvantages about overrunning and only touching the price where the order is triggered)?\n\nOr should I rather not even think about selling calls without having the stock?"", 'How about giving a productive answer instead of giving me garbage?', 'I see, very interesting idea! Something I had not thought about.

The middle of the two strikes. \n\nIf that‚Äôs correct yes you can. It depends on the broker to my understanding but you can disentangle options packages on most and allocate them to different legs. \n\nNow to be clear, this is an actual strategy if it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm illustrating in a sense. It should also not be used the exact way spelled out. \n\nYou would have to look at the Greeks. At that point the deltas are most likely not at 1 so you are substituting it with a 1 delta stock. There could be situations where it would make sense to buy the stock to close a position and then sell the long call. I am not sure about that though on similar dte. If you had a long call leap for example. But most times you could just roll or btc instead of taking the additional steps.\n\nNow why I said it was a strategy, is because more sophisticated traders than I am at this point will buy shares and other options. They will do this to balance out the Greeks. Like if a trader on the floor is trying to capture pure theta and they have a -10 delta skew on a position they will buy ten shares to become delta neutral. \n\nThey will do similar strategies on a lot of Greeks. That‚Äôs like market maker and pit trader type of stuff though. I hope to get to that point of understanding but that‚Äôs a long ways off.']"
options,Selling ITM puts in order to get stock cheaper,"People usually talk about selling Cash secured puts that are near dated and out of the money in order to collect premium, expecting them to expire worthless, or buy them back for a profit.  Similarly when talking about selling covered calls, mostly they say to sell calls at or out of the money.

However I watched one random you tuber who talked about selling ITM covered calls.  He didnt elaborate much but after some thought it made sense to me.

So now Im considering selling ITM puts expecting to get assigned where the premium more than covers the difference between strike and the share price.

I expect that more volatility will benefit me as the seller and there will be an optimum strike that would depend on the delta.

time also would mean more premium but then you would have to wait to get assigned.  shorter dated options you still have to wait till the option buyer exercises it or it expires but at least that is sooner.

Anyone have anything to add?","['this isnt a new idea.\n\nhowever options are generally priced efficiently so the difference would be accounted for.', 'Selling an ITM put is synthetically the same as a covered call position', 'I often write just barely OTM puts on a stock I want to own. Usually very short term (1-2 weeks).  If the stock goes up and the option expires, I pocket the premium and repeat a few times.  If the stock goes ITM, I get assigned shares at close to the same price I would have bought it at anyway, plus I already got the premium. \n\nThe main downside is that is a stock is on a major upward trend, you can lose out on some gains this way.  I made a bit of cash chasing ZM shares during the pandemic, but would have done better if I just bought shares and sold them at the high. \n\nOther downside is that my options trades are infuriating to my CPA wife at tax time.  \n\nAnd I NEVER write puts on a stock I wouldn‚Äôt be happy to hold for a few years if I get assigned shares.', 'selling itm put means you are anticipating the price to go up and it will be worthless on expiration, otherwise you are going to overpay for the shares you will definitely get assigned.\n\nselling itm call means you are anticipating the price will go down and it will be worthless on expiration, otherwise you need to buy the shares at a much higher price only to sell them off at a lower price... or if it is a covered call, you are fine with that much gain because you figure you can buy back later at a lower price.', ""Interesting idea. Commenting so I can read some other bigger brained opinions on this subject later.\n\nEdit: did some quick reading and already think this is a potentially horrible idea.

Maybe show the video for more context , all im seeing is subtext.', 'I sell ITM calls and ITM puts all the time and roll em, sometimes out 6 months if they got too far ITM. \n\nI use my cash balance for buying stocks and selling calls, and the margin balance for selling puts‚Ä¶\n\nI always make sure that the puts I sell can be covered by cash acquired by getting assigned on a call option that week. \n\nI also buy OTM puts for some companies im selling CCs on, giving me a guaranteed sale if it dropped too far too fast, but that‚Äôs only if I feel my account is too risky at that time. \n\n\nIt‚Äôs fairly easy to generate a 20% yearly return cash wise, although drawdowns happen when getting called 100 shares of one company that went up and you need the cash to cover the put that was assigned from a company that went down.', '> Anyone have anything to add?\n\nIf your goal is to buy shares, this scheme may never achieve that goal. And you cap the upside of gains on the shares, exactly the same way as you would with a covered call. You may be okay with that, as you keep the premium as a consolation prize, but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nIf you do end up buying the shares, you run the risk of buying into an unrealized loss and end up a bag holder. For example, XYZ is $100 now and you want to buy 100 shares, so you sell an $120 put for $21. That meets your criteria for the opening credit being more than the parity value of the ITM put. Unfortunately for you, the stock tanks the next day to $69 and you are assigned early. So now you paid $120 nominal ($99 discounted by the credit) for something that is only worth $69. And it stays below $70 for a year and more.\n\nGranted, if the comparison scenario is just buy 100 shares at $100 with no put and no credit, you still end up a bag holder with a large unrealized loss if it tanks to $69 the next day. The net net between the two schemes is $1/share. Or in general, the excess time value over parity. So you have to decide if that $1/share, or whatever, is worth the possibility of not buying shares and missing out on a rally, for example, if XYZ rallies to $130 instead of dropping to $69. You gave up $30/share for $21/share.', 'I would only do this if you want shares and expect a significant move up. I have done what he does with covered calls.\n\nIt makes way more sense with covered calls. If you are ready to sell something sell it with a deep itm call. Get the extra premium on what you would have sold at that point. If the stock drops you‚Äôve removed equity from the position at its high and can retain the shares. I‚Äôve done it with puts on a position I want to enter for sure on things like O or MO when there a dip, I want premium, and I want to capture an upcoming dividend. It‚Äôs not nearly as useful as doing it with calls though. Capturing a dividend is the biggest reason I‚Äôve used puts this way.\n\nThe reason it‚Äôs not as good as with calls is because it ties up more liquidity than selling itm cc. Which frees up liquidity.']"

In this scenario, you can either exercise your position if you want to hold long term, or simply take your profits.\n\nKeep in mind however, your option still has extrinsic value because you bought some time on the contract.  I would figure out how much extrinsic value is in this position, and compare that with where you think LRCX should be.  If you think it should go lower, you should probably sell.  If you think it should stay here, sell some calls at an OTM strike and just collect some premium.

options,High convexity low cost short term hedges,"After playing around in TOS for a while, I‚Äôm crowdsourcing from the community because I‚Äôm stumped.

If I want to protect against a 4% decline in SPX in the next 1-3 days, what is the best hedge?

Here are my ideal criteria, maybe this is a fantasy, but:
- If a decline of 4% in 1-3 days, ideal payout would be 5X+ cost.  Assume that the VIX rises a little bit (say from 13% to 15%)
- If the market stays steady or declines slightly, assume VIX declines gradually
- If the decline doesn‚Äôt happen, I don‚Äôt want to killed on the debit.  So either super, super cheap short dated or a longer term hedge with high short term convexity that won‚Äôt lose 50% of its value for a non-event","[""> If I want to protect against a 4% decline in SPX in the next 1-3 days,\n\nDo you mean lose up to 4% and then stop losing, thus a protective put, or do you mean lose nothing up to 4%, but any losses over 4% might be amplified? Or something else?\n\n> If a decline of 4% in 1-3 days, ideal payout would be 5X+ cost. Assume that the VIX rises a little bit (say from 13% to 15%)\n\nThese goals seem contradictory to me. A 500% gain on a long deep OTM put is easy, but in terms of dollars, it probably won't make a dent in a 4% loss on a large SPX position.\n\nI think the biggest lack of clarity in your goals is whether you are trying to reduce risk, which necessarily ought to reduce reward, or increase risk in order have a chance at higher reward."", ""\nI know it depends on the delta you have , called a portfolio hedge.

Why would IV rise? Well your thesis includes a 4% drop on SPX in a few days in what is otherwise a strong bull trend. In such a case IV of OTM puts will rise. \n\nNow for the trades. The idea of the diagonal put is that a 4% OTM put calendar would be profitable if SPX drops 4% by expiration of the short leg. But if you buy a lower strike put on the long leg you reduce the debit to put on the trade and it becomes a diagonal. The upside is the hedge costs less to put on so you lose less if SPX stays flat or goes up. If it goes down more than 4% then the short put will be in the money and you could lose a lot of money. \n\nThe put butterfly is similar you would sell 2 puts 4% OTM and then buy one put on each side with the same distance between strikes. Butterflies are cheap to put on and you can only lose the debit. If you break one of the wings (reduce the distance between the strikes closest to the money) it can be put on even cheaper and maybe even at a credit, but if SPX goes down more than 4% you again could lose a lot.']"
